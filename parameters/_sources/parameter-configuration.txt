Configuration parameters
========================


The tables below contain an alphabetized list of all configuration parameters in the |EMOD_s| model.

.. include:: ../reuse/warning-case.txt

The illustration below shows how the simulation types are built upon one another. All parameters
available in the generic :term:`simulation type` are inherited by the vector simulation type. The
vector simulation type adds additional parameters specific to the biology of vector-borne diseases,
which in turn are inherited by the malaria simulation type and so on. Therefore, depending on the
simulation type you select, different parameters are available for you to use.

    In addition, simulation types for broader classes of disease can be extended to build your own
    disease-specific model.
