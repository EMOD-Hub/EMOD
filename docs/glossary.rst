agent-based model
    A type of simulation that models the actions and interactions of autonomous agents
    (both individual and collective entities such as organizations or groups).

Boost
    Free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source libraries aimed at a wide range of uses including
    parallel processing applications (Boost.MPI). For more information, please see the Boost
    website, http://www.boost.org.

boxcar function
    A mathematical function that is equal to zero over the entire real line except for a single
    interval where it is equal to a constant.

campaign
    A collection of events that use interventions to modify a :term:`simulation`.

campaign event
    A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign.

campaign file
    A :term:`JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` formatted file that contains the parameters that
    specify the distribution instructions for all interventions used in a campaign, such as
    diagnostic tests, the target demographic, and the timing and cost of interventions. The
    location of this file is specified in the :term:`configuration file` with the
    **Campaign_Filename** parameter. Typically, the file name is campaign.json.

channel
    A property of the simulation (for example, "Parasite Prevalence") that is accumulated once per
    simulated :term:`time step` and written to file, typically as an array of the accumulated values.

class factory
    A function that instantiate objects at run-time and use information
    from JSON-based configuration information in the creation of these objects.

configuration file
    A :term:`JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` formatted file that contains the parameters
    sufficient for initiating a simulation. It controls many different aspects of the
    simulation, such as population size, disease dynamics, and length of the simulation.
    Typically, the file name is config.json.

core
    In computing, a core refers to an independent central processing unit (CPU) in the computer.
    Multi-core computers have more than one CPU. However, through technologies such as Hyper-
    Threading Technology (HTT or HT), a single physical core can actually act like two virtual
    or logical cores, and appear to the operating system as two processors.

demographics file
    A :term:`JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` formatted file that contains the parameters that
    specify the demographics of a population, such as age distribution, risk, birthrate, and more.
    |IDM_s| provides demographics files for many geographic regions. This file is typically named <region>_demographics.json.

disease-specific build
    A build of the |exe_l| built using SCons without any dynamic link libraries (DLLs).

dynamic link library (DLL)
    Microsoft's implementation of a shared library, separate from the |exe_l|, that can be
    dynamically loaded (and unloaded when unneeded) at runtime. This loading can be explicit or
    implicit.

EMODule
    A modular component of |EMOD_s| that are consumed and used by the |exe_l|.
    Under Windows, a |module| is implemented as a :term:`dynamic link library (DLL)` and,
    under |Centos|, |modules| are currently not supported. |modules| are primarily custom reporters.

Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD)
    The modeling software from the |IDM_l| for disease researchers and developers to investigate
    disease dynamics, and to assist in combating a host of infectious diseases. You may see
    this referred to as Disease Transmission Kernel (DTK) in the source code.

Eradication.exe
    Typical (default) name for the |exe_l|, whether built using monolithic build or
    modular (|module|-enabled) build.

event coordinator
    A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign.

flattened file
    A single campaign or configuration file created by combining a default file with one or more
    overlay files. Multiple files must be flattened prior to running a simulation. Configuration
    files are flattened to a single-depth JSON file without nesting, the format required for
    consumption by the |exe_l|. Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily
    used for testing and experimentation.

Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT)
     A feature for modeling person-to-person transmission of diseases in heterogeneous population
     segments within a node for generic simulations.

high-performance computing (HPC)
    The use of parallel processing for running advanced applications efficiently, reliably,
    and quickly.

individual properties
    Labels that can be applied to individuals within a simulation and used to configure
    heterogeneous transmission, target interventions, and move individuals through a health care
    cascade.

input files
    The JSON and binary files used as inputs to an |EMOD_s| simulation. The primary input files
    are the JSON-formatted configuration, demographics, and campaign files. They may also
    include the binary files for migration, climate, population serialization, or load-
    balancing.

inset chart
    The default JSON output report for |EMOD_s| that includes multiple channels that contain
    data at each time step of the simulation. These channels include number of new infections,
    prevalence, number of recovered, and more.

intervention
    An object aimed at reducing the spread of a disease that is distributed either to an
    individual; such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet; or to a node; such as a larvicide. Additionally,
    initial disease outbreaks and intermediate interventions that schedule another intervention
    are implemented as interventions in the :term:`campaign file`.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    A human-readable, open standard, text-based file format for data interchange. It is
    typically used to represent simple data structures and associative arrays, and is
    language-independent. For more information, see https://www.json.org.

JSON
    See JavaSCript Object Notation.

Keyhole Markup Language (KML)
    A file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser, for example, Google Maps.
    The format uses an XML-based structure (tag-based structure with nested elements and
    attributes). Tags are case-sensitive.

Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG)
    A method for the linker to optimize code (for size and/or speed) after compilation has
    occurred. The compiled code is turned not into actual code, but instead into an intermediate
    language form (IL, but not to be confused with .NET IL which has a different purpose). The
    LTCG then, unlike the compiler, can see the whole body of code in all object files and be
    able to optimize the result more effectively.

Message Passing Interface (MPI)
    An interface used to pass information between computing cores in parallel simulations. One
    example is the migration of individuals from one geographic location to another within |EMOD_s|
    simulations.

microsolver
    A type of "miniature model" that operates within the framework of |EMOD_s|
    to compute a particular set of parameters. Each microsolver, in effect, is creating a
    microsimulation in order to accurately capture the dynamics of that particular aspect of the
    model.

Monte Carlo method
    A class of algorithms using repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte
    Carlo simulations create probability distributions for possible outcomes, which provides a
    more realistic way of describing uncertainty.

monolithic build
    A single |exe_l| with no DLLs that includes all components as part of |exe_s| itself. You
    can still use |modules| with the monolithic build; for example, a
    custom reporter is a common type of |module|. View the documentation on |modules| and
    emodules_map.json for more information about creation and use of |modules|.

node
    A grid size that is used for modeling geographies. Within |EMOD_s|, a node is a geographic
    region containing simulated individuals. Individuals migrate between nodes either
    temporarily or permanently using mobility patterns driven by local, regional, and long-
    distance transportation.

node properties
    Labels that can be applied to nodes within a simulation and used to target interventions based on geography.

node-targeted intervention
    An intervention that is distributed to a geographical node rather than to a single
    individual. One example is larvicides, which affect all mosquitoes living and feeding within
    a given node.

nodes
    See :term:`node`.

output report
    A file that is the output from an |EMOD_s| simulation. Output reports are in JSON, CSV, or binary
    file format. You must pass the data from an output report to graphing software if you want to
    visualize the output of a simulation.

overlay file
    An additional configuration, campaign, or demographic file that overrides the default
    parameter values in the primary file. Separating the parameters into multiple files is
    primarily used for testing a nd experimentation. In the case of configuration and campaign
    files, the files can use an arbitrary hierarchical structure to organize parameters into
    logical groups. Configuration and campaign files must be flattened into a single file before
    running a simulation.

preview
    Software that undergoes a shorter testing cycle in order to make it available
    more quickly. Previews may contain software defects that could result in unexpected
    behavior. Use |EMOD_s| previews at your own discretion.

regression test
    A test to verify that existing |EMOD_s| functionality works with new
    updates, located in the Regression subdirectory of the |EMOD_s| source code repository. Directory names of each
    subdirectory  in Regression describe the main regression attributes, for example,
    "1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNode". Also can refer to the process of regression testing of
    software.

release
    Software that includes new functionality, scientific tutorials leveraging new or existing
    functionality, and/or bug fixes that have been thoroughly tested so that any defects have
    been fixed before release. |EMOD_s| releases undergo full regression testing.

reporter
    Functionality that extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and saves it as an
    :term:`output report`. |EMOD_s| provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from
    simulations and you also have the ability to create a custom reporter.

scenario
    A collection of input files that describes a real-world example of a disease outbreak and
    interventions. Many scenarios are included with |EMOD_s| source installations or are
    available to download at `EMOD scenarios`_ to learn more about epidemiology and disease
    modeling.

schema
    A text or JSON file that can be generated from the |exe_l| that defines all
    configuration and campaign parameters.

simulation
    An execution of the |EMOD_s| software using an associated set of input files.

simulation type
    The disease or disease class to model.

    .. include:: reuse/sim-types.txt

solvers
    Solvers are used to find computational solutions to problems. In simulations, they can be used,
    for example, to determine the time of the next simulation step, or to compute the states of
    a model at particular time steps.

Standard Template Library (STL)
    A library that contains a set of common C++ classes (including generic algorithms and data
    structures) that are independent of container and implemented as templates, which enables
    compile-time polymorphism (often more efficient than run-time polymorphism). For more
    information and discussion of STL, see `Wikipedia -
    Standard Template Library <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library>`__
    for more information.

state transition event
    A change in state (e.g. healthy to infected, undiagnosed to positive diagnosis, or birth)
    that may trigger a subsequent action, often an intervention. "Campaign events" should not be
    confused with state transition events.

time step
    A discrete number of hours or days in which the "simulation states" of all "simulation
    objects" (interventions, infections, immune systems, or individuals) are updated in a
    simulation. Each time step will complete processing before launching the next one. For
    example, a time step would process the migration data for populations moving between nodes
    via rail, airline, and road. The migration of individuals between nodes is the last step of
    the time step after updating states.

tutorial
    A set of instructions in the documentation to learn more about epidemiology and
    disease modeling. Tutorials are based on real-world scenarios and demonstrate the mechanics
    of the the model. Each tutorial consists of one or more scenarios.

working directory
    The directory that contains the configuration and campaign files for a simulation. You must
    be in this directory when you invoke |exe_s| at the command line to run a simulation.
