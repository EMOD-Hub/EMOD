=======================
Advancing |EMOD_s| code
=======================

This documentation set provides information for researchers and developers who want to modify the
|EMOD_l| source code to add more functionality to the model. For example, by adding custom reports
or creating a new simulation type for modeling a disease that |EMOD_s| doesn't currently support. 
The docs describe how to build the |exe_l| from source code, run tests, debug errors, and more. 

If you instead want information on how to run |EMOD_s| as provided for malaria, HIV, or generic 
simulations, see one of the documentation sets linked below.
