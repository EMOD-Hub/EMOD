==================
|HINT_l| tutorials
==================

The |HINT_l| tutorials consist of a group of scenarios that guide you through simulations that will
help you understand the |HINT_s| feature, which allows you to configure heterogeneous disease
transmission between different groups defined with **IndividualProperties**. Each tutorial has a
corresponding Scenarios directory and a demographics file in the Scenarios\InputFiles directory. All
of these tutorials have an **IndividualProperties** attribute in their demographics files. An
**IndividualProperties** attribute with a **TransmissionMatrix** is a requirement for a |HINT_s|
simulation. Additionally, **Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission** must be set to 1 (true) in
the simulation :term:`configuration file` (config.json).

There are two ways to use the tutorials. You can read the tutorials information and graphs to learn
about the model; installing |EMOD_s| is not required. Or, for a more hands-on approach, you
can also run the simulations that are associated with the tutorials and make the suggested changes
to the configuration files to see the impact on the output graphs. See :doc:`install-overview` for
installation instructions and :doc:`howto-simulations` for information on how to run |EMOD_s|
simulations.

Refer to :doc:`parameter-overview` for more information regarding individual parameters that
you are interested in modifying.

For more information about the mathematics behind |HINT_s|, see `Heterogeneity and transmission scaling`_
in the generic disease documentation.
