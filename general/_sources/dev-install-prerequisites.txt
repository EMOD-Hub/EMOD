===================================================
Prerequisites for working with |EMOD_s| source code
===================================================

This section describes the software packages or utilities must be installed to build the |exe_l| or
|linux_binary| from source code and run regression tests.

If additional software is needed for the prerequisite software due to your specific environment, the
installer for the prerequisite software should provide instructions. For example, if |MSMPI_supp|
requires additional Visual C++ redistributable packages, the installer will display that
information.

.. include:: ../reuse/third-party-note.txt

Install prerequisites for building |exe_s|
==========================================

The following software packages are required to build the |exe_s| from |EMOD_s| source code on
|Windows_supp|.

.. note::

    You must also have already installed the required software to run |EMOD_s| simulations.
    If you have not, see :doc:`install-overview`.

Visual Studio
-------------

#.  Purchase a license from Microsoft or use an MSDN subscription to install |VS_supp|. Other versions
    of Visual Studio are not supported.

    While you can use a free copy of Visual Studio Community, |IDM_s| does not test on or support this version.

#.  Select the Visual C++ tools for Windows desktop during installation.


Python
------

Python is required for building the disease-specific |exe_s| and running Python scripts.

.. note::

    |EMOD_s| does not support the current version of Python.

.. include:: ../reuse/python-install.txt

HPC SDK
-------

*  Install the |HPC_SDK_supp|. See |HPC_SDK_supp_path| for instructions.

Boost
-----

#.  Go to |Boost_supp_path| and select one of the compressed files.
#.  Unpack the libraries to the location of your choice.
#.  From **Control Panel**, select **Advanced system settings**, and then click
    **Environment Variables**.
#.  Add a new variable called IDM_BOOST_PATH and set it to the directory where you installed
    Boost, and then click **OK**.

SCons
-----

SCons is required for the building disease-specific |exe_s| and is optional for the monolithic |exe_s|
that includes all simulation types.

#.  Go to |Scons_supp_path| and select the WHL file for |Scons_supp| that is compatible with
    |Python_supp|.
#.  Save the file to your Python installation directory.
#.  Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the Python installation directory, then enter the
    following, substituting the name of the specific matplotlib WHL file you downloaded::

        pip install scons-2.x.x-py2-none-any.whl

Install prerequisites for building the |linux_binary|
=====================================================

For |Centos_supp|, all prerequisites for building the |linux_binary| are installed by the setup
script described in :doc:`install-centos`. If you originally installed |EMOD_s| without including
the source code and input data files that are optional for running simulations using a pre-built
|linux_binary|, rerun the script and install those.

Install prerequisites for running regression tests
==================================================

The following plotting software is required for running regression tests, where graphs of model
output are created both before and after source code changes are made to see if those changes
created a discrepancy in the regression test output. For more information, see
:doc:`dev-regression`. For |Centos_supp|, all Python packages are installed by the setup
script, but you may want to install R or MATLAB.

.. include:: ../reuse/gohlke.txt

Python utilities
----------------

.. include:: ../reuse/python-utility-install.txt

NumPy
-----

.. include:: ../reuse/numpy-install.txt

Matplotlib
-----------

.. include:: ../reuse/matplotlib-install.txt

R
-

The |IDM_s| test team uses |R_supp| for regression testing, but it is considered optional.

.. include:: ../reuse/r-install.txt

MATLAB
------

The |IDM_s| test team uses |MATLAB_supp| and the |stats_supp| for regression testing, but they are both
considered optional.

.. include:: ../reuse/matlab-install.txt
