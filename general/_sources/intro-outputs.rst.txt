============
Output files
============

After running a simulation, the simulation data is extracted, aggregated, and saved as an
:term:`output report`. Depending on your configuration, one or more output reports will be created,
each of which summarize different data from the simulation. Output reports can be in JSON, CSV, or
binary file formats.

The |EMOD_s| functionality that produces an output report is known as a :term:`reporter`. |EMOD_s|
provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from simulations. By default, |EMOD_s| will
always generate the report InsetChart.json, which contains the simulation-wide average disease
prevalence by :term:`time step`. If none of the provided reports generates the output report that
you require, you can create a custom reporter.

If you want to visualize the data output from an |EMOD_s| simulation, you must use graphing
software to plot the output reports. In addition to output reports, |EMOD_s| will generate error
and logging files to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.
