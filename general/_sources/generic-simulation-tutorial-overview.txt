Generic simulation tutorials
============================

The generic simulation tutorials consist of a group of scenarios that guide you through simulations
that will help you understand how to use a :term:`configuration file`, :term:`campaign file`, and
input data files to run |EMOD_s| simulations. Each scenario has a corresponding directory and a
demographics file in the Regression\Scenarios\InputFiles directory so you can run the simulation on your
computer. All of these configuration files (config.json) have **Simulation_Type** set to
GENERIC_SIM.

There are two ways to use the tutorials. You can read the tutorials information and graphs to learn
about the model; installing |EMOD_s| is not required. Or, for a more hands-on approach, you can also
run the simulations that are associated with the tutorials and make the suggested changes to the
configuration files to see the impact on the output graphs. See :doc:`install-overview` for
installation instructions and :doc:`howto-simulations` for information on how to run |EMOD_s|
simulations.

You can refer to :doc:`parameter-overview` for more information regarding individual parameters that
you are interested in modifying.
