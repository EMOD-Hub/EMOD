===============================================
Welcome to |IDM_s| modeling for general disease
===============================================

The |IDM_l| develops complex software modeling. The primary software, |EMOD_l|, helps determine the
combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. We
share this modeling software with the research community to advance the understanding of disease
dynamics.

Documentation structure
=======================

|IDM_s| recently separated the documentation into disease-specific sets that provide guidance for
researchers modeling particular diseases. For example, this documentation set includes general
installation and usage instructions for the generic disease model, which can be used to model
a variety of diseases.

"Using the model" contains information for researchers who want to create simulations of disease
dynamics using |EMOD_s| as developed by |IDM_s|.

"Advancing the model" contains information for researchers and developers who want to modify
the |EMOD_s| source code to add more functionality to the model.
