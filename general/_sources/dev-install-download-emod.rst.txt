========================================
Download the |EMOD_s| source code
========================================

The |EMOD_s| source code is available on GitHub. The |EMOD_s| source includes the source code,
Visual Studio solution, sample configuration files, as well as :term:`regression test` and other
files needed to fully build and test the |exe_l|.

You can have multiple versions of the |EMOD_s| source code in separate directories on your local
computer. For example, you might want to download a new release of |EMOD_s| but also keep a previous
release of the source. In the following examples, the source code is downloaded to the directory
|EMOD_s| at C:/IDM, but you can save to any location you want.

You can use a Git client of your choice to download from GitHub, however, these instructions show
how to use Git GUI and Git Bash.

Install Git GUI and Git Bash
============================

To install Git GUI and Git Bash, download a 64-bit version of Git from https://git-scm.com/download.
On the **Select Components** installer window, you can select one or both of **Git GUI Here** for a
GUI or **Git Bash Here** for a command window.

Use Git GUI to download the |EMOD_s| source
===========================================

#.  Launch the Git GUI application and click **Clone Existing Repository**.

#.  From the **Clone Existing Repository** window:

    #.  In **Source Location**, enter https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD

    #.  In **Target Directory**, enter the location and target directory name: C:/IDM/EMOD

    #.  Click **Clone**. Git GUI will create the directory and download the source code.
#.  Close the Git GUI window when the download completes.

Use Git Bash to download the |EMOD_s| source
============================================

.. note::

    For a list of the Git Bash commands, you can type ``git help git`` from Git Bash, or ``git help
    <command>`` for information about a specific command.

#.  Launch the Git Bash application. From the command line:

    #.  Go to the location where you want your copy of the |EMOD_s| source located::

            cd C:\IDM

    #.  Clone the repository from GitHub::

            git clone https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD

Git Bash will copy the |EMOD_s| source to a directory named |EMOD_s| by default as a
different directory name was not specified after the URL.

Verify that all directories on https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD are now reflected
on your local clone of the repository. The table below describes each of the directories.
