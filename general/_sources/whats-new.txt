This topic describes new functionality and breaking changes for recently released versions of
|EMOD_l|.

|EMOD_s| v2.10
==============

The |EMOD_s| source v2.10 release includes new and updated malaria configuration, demographic, and
intervention parameters. With this release, |EMOD_s| now uses |VS_2015|, |Boost_161|, and |Scons_25|.

    Malaria
    -------

    Several habitat parameters in the malaria model have been upgraded, creating more flexibility in
    the model and enabling the user to have more control over habitat customization. These changes
    allow the model to more accurately capture real-world habitat availability and how it affects
    different mosquito species.

    **LINEAR_SPLINE** habitat type
        This new option under **Larval_Habitat_Types** increases model customization by allowing the
        user to specify an arbitrary functional form (derived from data) for larval habitat
        availability throughout the year, instead of relying on climatological parameters such as
        rainfall or temperature. For more information, see :ref:`config-vectorspecies` parameters.

    **LarvalHabitatMultiplier** by species
        This new feature in demographics allows larval habitat availability to be modified
        independently for each species sharing a particular habitat type. Prior versions of |EMOD_s|
        applied the same modifier to all species within a shared habitat; this upgrade enables you
        to apply modifiers to individual species within a habitat. For more information, see
        :ref:`demo-nodeattributes` parameters.

    **ScaleLarvalHabitat** by species
        This new intervention enables species-specific effects of habitat interventions within
        shared habitat types, such that habitat availability is modified on a per-species level.
        For more information, see :ref:`iv-scalelarvalhabitat` parameters.

    Breaking changes
        PIECEWISE_MONTHLY has been changed to LINEAR_SPLINE.

|EMOD_s| software upgrades
--------------------------

Microsoft Visual Studio
    |EMOD_s| now uses |VS_2015|, and |VS_2012| is no longer supported. The Visual Studio solution
    file in the |EMOD_s| source, EradicationKernel, has been updated for |VS_2015|. If you have
    custom reporter EMODules (DLLS) that were built using |VS_2012|, you will need to rebuild them
    with |VS_2015|; otherwise, your simulation will crash when it attempts to load the DLLs built
    by |VS_2012|.

Boost
    |EMOD_s| now supports using |Boost_161|. If you continue to use |Boost_151|, you will get the
    following warning, "Unknown compiler version - please run the configure tests and report the
    results."

Environment variables
    To make it easier to use Boost and Python with Visual Studio, |IDM_s| paths have been created.
    These two paths, IDM_BOOST_PATH and IDM_PYTHON_PATH, need to be added to your  environment
    variables by using either the **setx** command from a command line or the Windows System
    Properties panel.

SCons
    |EMOD_s| was tested using |Scons_25|, as it supports |VS_2015|. If you do not add the new
    |IDM_s| environment variables for Boost and Python, you will need to modify the Boost and
    Python paths in the SConstruct file in the |EMOD_s| root directory.


Python
    |EMOD_s| was tested with Python 2.7.11 and 2.7.12. If you are building the |exe_l| and have
    an earlier version of Python (for example, 2.7.2), you will see the following warning message on some
    files, "c:\python27\include\pymath.h(22): warning C4273: 'round': inconsistent dll linkage."
    Upgrade to Python 2.7.11 or 2.7.12 to get rid of the warning message.
