Whatâ€™s new

This topic describes new functionality and breaking changes for recently released versions of
|EMOD_l|.

|EMOD_s| v2.10
==============

The |EMOD_s| source v2.10 release includes new and updated malaria configuration, demographic, and
intervention parameters. With this release, |EMOD_s| now uses |VS_2015|, |Boost_161|, and |Scons_25|.


|EMOD_s| software upgrades
--------------------------

Microsoft Visual Studio
    |EMOD_s| now uses |VS_2015|, and |VS_2012| is no longer supported. The Visual Studio solution
    file in the |EMOD_s| source, EradicationKernel, has been updated for |VS_2015|. If you have
    custom reporter EMODules (DLLS) that were built using |VS_2012|, you will need to rebuild them
    with |VS_2015|; otherwise, your simulation will crash when it attempts to load the DLLs built
    by |VS_2012|.

Boost
    |EMOD_s| now supports using |Boost_161|. If you continue to use |Boost_151|, you will get the
    following warning, "Unknown compiler version - please run the configure tests and report the
    results."

Environment variables
    To make it easier to use Boost and Python with Visual Studio, |IDM_s| paths have been created.
    These two paths, IDM_BOOST_PATH and IDM_PYTHON_PATH, need to be added to your  environment
    variables by using either the **setx** command from a command line or the Windows System
    Properties panel.

SCons
    |EMOD_s| was tested using |Scons_25|, as it supports |VS_2015|. If you do not add the new
    |IDM_s| environment variables for Boost and Python, you will need to modify the Boost and
    Python paths in the SConstruct file in the |EMOD_s| root directory.


Python
    |EMOD_s| was tested with Python 2.7.11 and 2.7.12. If you are building the |exe_l| and have
    an earlier version of Python (for example, 2.7.2), you will see the following warning message on some
    files, "c:\python27\include\pymath.h(22): warning C4273: 'round': inconsistent dll linkage."
    Upgrade to Python 2.7.11 or 2.7.12 to get rid of the warning message.
