Running a simulation
====================

The |exe_l| consumes the :term:`input data files`, :term:`configuration file`, and, optionally,
:term:`campaign file` to run simulations that model disease dynamics and campaign efficacy. You
have a few different options for running simulations. The option you choose will depend upon
whether you want to run one or more simulations, to run simulations locally or on a remote
cluster (for large simulations or multiple simulations), or to run simulations for debugging the
source code. This topic briefly describes the different options you have for running
simulations.

Run a single simulation
=======================

You will generally want to run simulations using the |EMOD_s| command-line options. This will
run a single simulation and put the output files in a local directory.

You must either download the latest version of |exe_s| from GitHub or clone the |EMOD_s| source from
GitHub and build |exe_s| yourself. This gives you access to the latest features and parameters for
|EMOD_s|.

Run multiple simulations
========================

Because the |EMOD_s| model is :term:`stochastic`, simulations must be run multiple times to return
scientifically valid results. Therefore, you have the following options to run multiple simulations
at a time, either locally or remotely on a :term:`high-performance computing (HPC)` cluster.
Generally, only small simulations should be run locally.

Many of these options are scripting languages that you can also use to modify the files consumed by
|EMOD_s|, simplifying your workflow when running many simulations.

Run simulations for debugging
=============================

If you are helping advance the |EMOD_s| model by contributing to source code, there are other
options for running simulations that provide debugging support. These options for running
simulations are not recommended if you are not modifying the source code.

You can run a simulation locally from Visual Studio using the built-in debugger. You will be able
to put in breakpoints and step through the code while inspecting the values of different state
variables throughout the simulation.

You can use regression_test.py in the GitHub Regression_ directory to run multiple simulations
on a cluster, including running the suite of regression tests run by the |IDM_s| testing team.
