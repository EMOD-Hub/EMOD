==================================================
Generic 4: SEIR - Vital dynamics (birth and death)
==================================================

This tutorial assumes that you have read :doc:`generic-tutorial3SEIR`.

This tutorial explores the effect of birth and death on a simulation. In a closed population with no
vital dynamics, an epidemic will eventually die out due to an insufficient number of susceptible
individuals to sustain the disease. Infected individuals who are added later will not start another
epidemic due to the life-long immunity of the existing population.

If there are vital dynamics, new births can provide more susceptible individuals to the population.
In this case, when infected individuals are added later, another epidemic may start.


Demographics inputs
===================

In the demographics input file, the node has 10,000 individuals. The birth rate and death rate are
equal to 20 per 1000 individuals per year (0.0000548 per day).

The birth rate and initial population values are set in NodeAttributes using **BirthRate** and
**InitialPopulation**, respectively. The death rate is set in **IndividualAttributes** using the
**MortalityDistribution**. Both the male and female death rate is equal to 0.0000548 per day.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic4-demographics1.json
  :language: JSON


To view the complete demographics file, see generic_scenarios_demographics at
<path_to_directory>\Regression\Scenarios\InputFiles where <path_to_directory> is the location where
|EMOD_s| source files were installed. For more information on demographics files, see
:doc:`parameter-demographics`.


Key simulation parameters
=========================

This tutorial simulates the person-person disease transmission as an :term:`SEIR model` in a hypothetical
community over a longer period.

You can view the complete config.json in <path_to_directory>\Regression\Scenarios\Generic\04_VitalDynamics
directory.


Population dynamics parameters
------------------------------

The following parameters enable vital dynamics for birth and non-disease related deaths, and disable
disease-related mortality. For more information, see :ref:`config-population` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Enable_Vital_Dynamics** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Birth** to 1.

  * Set **Death_Rate_Dependence** to "NONDISEASE_MORTALITY_BY_AGE_AND_GENDER."

  * Set **Enable_Disease_Mortality** to 0.



SEIR model setup parameters
---------------------------

The incubation period, infection period, and immunity must be enabled for an SEIR model. Immunity
waning must be disabled. For more information, see :ref:`config-incubation` and :ref:`config-immunity` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Incubation_Period** to 3.

  * Set **Enable_Immunity** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Immune_Decay** to 0.

  * Set **Incubation_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION."


Disease parameters
------------------

These parameters configure an SEIR-like disease model with person-to-person direct transmission. The
basic reproductive number is 17.5.

The birth and death rates are calculated based on the base birth and mortality rates in the
demographics file, as well as the multiplier in the configuration file. The birth and death
(mortality) rates are increased by a factor of 10 using multipliers, **x_Birth** and
**x_Other_Mortality**, to show the effect of the vital process. In this tutorial, the birth rate
equals the mortality rate. For more information, see :ref:`config-infectivity` and
:ref:`config-scalars` parameters.


Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 2.5.

  * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 7.

  * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DURATION."

  * Set **x_Birth** to 10.

  * Set **x_Other_Mortality** to 10.



Simulation duration parameters
------------------------------

The simulation runs a 10 year simulation with a 1-day time step. For more information, see
:ref:`config-setup` parameters.

Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Simulation_Timestep** to 1.

  * Set **Simulation_Duration** to 3650.


Interventions
=============

Prior immunity
--------------

This tutorial assumes that 80% of individuals are immune at the beginning of the simulation. This is
simulated using a vaccination campaign with 80% coverage and 100% take at day 1.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic4-interventions1.json
  :language: JSON


Outbreaks
---------

This simulation uses an **OutbreakIndividual** event for an infrequent infection seeding. The
**Timesteps_Between_Repetitions** and **Number_Repetitions** parameters are set to reintroduce the
outbreak once every two years for 10 years. With larger population sizes, the endemic can sustain
itself. For more information, see :ref:`iv-outbreakindividual` parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/generic4-interventions2.json
  :language: JSON


You can view the complete campaign.json in <path_to_directory>\Regression\Scenarios\Generic\04_VitalDynamics
directory.


Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`howto-simulations`.


.. include:: ../reuse/note-stochastic.txt


Simulation output graphs
------------------------

The output shows the periodic outbreaks when an infection is reseeded because of the accumulation of
new susceptibles due to the vital process (new births). Since periodic endemic behavior cannot be
maintained due to stochastic fadeout in a small population, **OutbreakIndividual** was used to
reintroduce the outbreak every two years for 10 years.

Exploring the model
===================

Shut down the vital dynamics by setting **Enable_Vital_Dynamics** to 0 in the
Scenarios\Generic\04_SEIR_VitalDynamics\config.json file. Eventually, the number of susceptible
individuals will be exhausted and a reintroduction of the outbreak will not cause a new outbreak.

Experiment with increasing the birth rate and population size in the generic_scenarios_demographics
file. At a certain point, the influx of population might be enough to sustain the dynamics without
reintroducing an outbreak.
