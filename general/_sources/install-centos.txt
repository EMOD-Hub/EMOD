=============================
Install |EMOD_s| on |Centos|
=============================

Follow the steps below to install |EMOD_s| on |Centos_supp| environments. This installs the pre-
built |linux_binary| and all software needed to run simulations. The setup script installs most
prerequisite software, including Python and the Python packages dateutil, six, pyparsing, NumPy, and
matplotlib. Other prerequisites, such as |Boost_supp| and  |MSMPI_supp|, are declared by the script
as required. Because the installation instructions will vary based on the particular distribution
you are running, instruction information is not included here.

.. note::

    If you want to download and modify the |EMOD_s| source code and build the |linux_binary|
    yourself, see :doc:`dev-install-overview`.

.. include:: ../reuse/testing-linux.txt

.. include:: ../reuse/third-party-note.txt

The script provides the option of installing the |EMOD_s| source code and :term:`input
data files` provided by |IDM_s|, but these steps will install a pre-built version of the |linux_binary|.
For information on building the |linux_binary| from source code, see :doc:`dev-install-overview`.

Before you begin, you must have the following:

* **sudo** privileges to install packages
* 15 GB free in your home directory (if you install the |EMOD_s| source code and input data files)
* An Internet connection


#.  Download and run the PrepareLinuxEnvironment.sh script on `EMOD releases`_ on GitHub.

    Respond to the prompts for information while the script is running. If you choose not to
    download the |EMOD_s| source and input data files, do the following. This example assumes that a
    directory named |IDM_s| is in your home directory and contains the subdirectories |EMOD_s|,
    containing the |EMOD_s| source code, and EMOD_InputData, containing the input data files
    directory.

    a.  Set the EMOD_ROOT environment variable to the path to the |EMOD_s| source path::

            EMOD_ROOT=~/IDM/EMOD

    b.  Put Scripts and . in the path::

            export PATH=$PATH:.:$EMOD_ROOT/Scripts

    c.  Create a symlink from the |EMOD_s| directory to InputDataFiles::

            ln -s /home/general/IDM/EMOD-InputData $EMOD_ROOT/InputData

    d.  If you run simulations using in the same session that you updated EMOD_ROOT and
        the Scripts path, reload the .bashrc file using ``source .bashrc``.

#.  Download the |linux_binary| for |Centos_supp|. See on `EMOD releases`_ on GitHub.

(Optional) Install plotting software
====================================

None of the following plotting software is required to run simulations with |EMOD_s|, but they are
useful for creating graphs from and evaluating the model output. In addition, |EMOD_s| provides many
Python scripts for analyzing data.
