Run simulations
===============

There are a number of ways to run an |EMOD_s| simulation, whether locally or on a remote HPC
cluster. The simplest way is to run a simulation at the command line, however that limits you to
running one local simulation at a time. Because the |EMOD_s| model is :term:`stochastic`, you must
run many simulations before you can interpret the outcome. You may want to use a scripting language
like Python or MATLAB or an application like mpiexec to run multiple simulations at once.

In addition, if you are modifying the |EMOD_s| source code to add functionality to the model, you
can run simulations in Visual Studio as part of debugging. This process is described in
:doc:`dev-simulations`.

No matter how you choose to run simulations, you must have a built copy of the |exe_l| or
|linux_binary|, either downloaded directly from GitHub or built from the |EMOD_s| source code. See
:doc:`install-overview`. In addition, you must know the paths to the configuration file and
:term:`input data files` and where you want to store the output files. You will pass this
information as arguments to |exe_s|.

Directory structure
===================

Although there are many ways you can structure the files needed to run a simulation, we recommend
the following to keep your files organized and simplify the file paths set in the configuration file
or passed as arguments to |exe_s|.

*   Place the configuration and campaign files needed for a simulation in the same directory. This
    is also known as the :term:`working directory`.

    However, if you are using overlay files, you may want the default configuration or campaign file
    in a separate directory so they can be used with different overlay files for other simulations.

*   Place all input data files for a given region in the same directory.
*   Place output for a simulation in a subdirectory of the directory containing configuration
    and campaign files.

It is not important where you install |exe_s| or the |linux_binary|.
