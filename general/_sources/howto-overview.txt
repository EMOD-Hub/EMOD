How to use the software
=======================

This section contains detailed procedural information about how to use |EMOD_l|. For example, how to
download :term:`input data files`, how to set up groups in a population, how to create a
:term:`configuration file` and :term:`campaign file`, how to run simulations both locally and on a
remote HPC cluster, and more.

The architecture diagram below shows, at a high level, how the system functions.

   High-level |EMOD_s| system architecture

For more information about how each component of the system fits together, see :doc:`intro-overview`.
That section provides a conceptual overview of |EMOD_s| and describes each required or optional
component for running a simulation.
