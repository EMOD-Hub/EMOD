|HINT_s| 2: School closure
==========================

This tutorial replicates disease transmission dynamics through the different activities of
individuals. In this tutorial, a group is defined by the place where individuals go for similar
activities but it is not tied to one specific geographic location. For example, "school" represents
all of the students that are going to school instead of having a group for every school that the
students attend. As another example, "community" represents places that people meet for varying
activities outside of school and work, such as shopping, getting gas, or going to a movie.

This tutorial also shows the effect of disease-control policies that modify group mixing during a
disease outbreak (for example, the effect of closing schools during a hypothetical pandemic).
Students are transitioned from the school group to another group during school closure, and reverted
back to the school group when the school is reopened. There are two distinct groups that represent
the different activities of school-age children during a school closure:

* Children who mostly stay at home and the contact rates were largely reduced.

* Children who spend more time outside of home and have more contacts with other groups

Demographics inputs

IndividualProperties
--------------------

Property and values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Property** and **Values** members of **IndividualProperties** define five groups. There are
three groups that represent the places where individuals normally go when schools are open. There
are two groups that represent the place where students go during a school closure. For more information,
see :ref:`demo-properties` parameters.

Normal activity groups:

School
    Students who are in school.
Work
    People who are working outside of the home.
Community
    General activities for people who neither work nor go to school.


School closure groups:

SchoolBreak_Interaction
    Students who do activities outside of the home during a school break.
SchoolBreak_NonInteraction
    Students who mostly stay at home during a school break.


Initial_Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning of the simulation, every individual has a 10% chance of being assigned to
"Community", 30% chance to "School", and 60% chance to "Work" as specified by the **Initial_Distribution**
array. Individuals are not assigned to **SchoolBreak_Interaction** and **SchoolBreak_NonInteraction** at the
beginning of the simulation.


Transitions
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Transitions** is used to move individuals from one property value (group) to another. All of the
individuals in "School" are moved to **SchoolBreak_NonInteraction** on day 20 and moved back to
"School" 20 days later (day 40). For more information, see :ref:`demo-transitions`.

**SchoolBreak_Interaction** is not used in this tutorial. It is added to the demographics file so that
you can easily run some variations of this simulation.


TransmissionMatrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TransmissionMatrix** contains the :math:`\beta` values of the :term:`WAIFW matrix`. The
transmission **Route** is "Contact". The :math:`\beta` values are added to **Matrix**.

The first three rows and columns of Matrix demonstrate a hypothetical transmission rate between the
three groups: "Community", "School", and "Work". Students are a main driver of disease transmission. The
last two columns and rows demonstrate the different behaviors when students are not in school. Note
that the fourth column and row for **SchoolBreak_Interaction** have a much higher transition rate than
**SchoolBreak_NonInteraction** in the fifth row and column.

Key configuration parameters
============================

The simulation simulates the person-person disease transmission of influenza-like-illness model
(SEIR) in a hypothetical community over a short period. For more information, see
:ref:`config-infectivity` and :ref:`config-incubation` parameters.  You can view the config.json file in the
Scenarios\HINT\02_SchoolClosure directory.


Set the following parameters:

  * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 1.

  * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 1.8.

  * Set **Base_Incubation_Period** to 1.

  * Set **Enable_Heterogeneous_Intranode_Transmission** to 1.

  * Set **Incubation_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DURATION."

  * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DURATION."



Interventions
=============

An **OutbreakIndividual** event seeds the initial infection on day 1 of the simulation. For more
information, see **OutbreakIndividual** parameters.

You can view the campaign.json file in the in the Scenarios\HINT\02_SchoolClosure directory.

Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`howto-simulations`.


.. include:: ../reuse/note-stochastic.txt

Expected simulation output
--------------------------

The output shows the effect of school break under the assumption that students will reduce their
contact during the break (**SchoolBreak_NonInteraction**).

The following graph shows the daily number of infected people for each group in the simulation. It
is clear that since students are the major driver of transmission, and the fact that students do not
interact much with other groups during the break, the school break was able to delay the epidemic
for 20 days.

Exploring the model
===================

Change the transition in :term:`intervention` to **SchoolBreak_Interaction**. In this case, students will
interact more with other groups, therefore, it is expected that a school break does not necessarily
slow down the epidemic.
