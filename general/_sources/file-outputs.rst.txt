=======================
Output report structure
=======================

This topic defines various data output reports that the |exe_l| can produce. These reports are built
in to the |exe_s| and are either always output with each simulation, such as inset chart, or reports
that you can configure to be included with the output. All output reports can be found in the output
directory of the working directory, for example, 1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNode\output.

If the available output reports do not meet your needs, you can use custom reporters that are
|modules| separate from the |exe_s| code. There are several provided in the |EMOD_s| GitHub
repository or you can even write your own custom reporter to post- process and format data as you
desire into a new output report. For more information, see :doc:`howto-custom-reporter`.


.. none of the STI or HIV reports are included here.

.. simulation-specific reports are included in the disease-specific docsets as an additional
