Create a campaign file
======================

You define the initial disease outbreak and interventions used a campaign for a simulation through a
JSON-formatted campaign file, typically called campaign.json. It is hierarchically organized into
logical groups of parameters that can have arbitrary levels of nesting. For some interventions,
there can be a very complex hierarchical structure, including recursion. This framework enables
rigorous testing of possible control strategies to determine which events or combination of events
will best aid in the elimination of disease for specific geographic locations.

For a complete list of campaign parameters that are available to use with this simulation type and
more detail about the campaign file structure, see :doc:`parameter-campaign`. For more information about
JSON, see :doc:`parameter-overview`.

For the interventions to take place, the campaign file must be in the same directory as the
:term:`configuration file` and you must set the configuration parameters **Enable_Interventions** to
1 and **Campaign_Filename** to the name of the campaign file.

The |EMOD_s| Regression_ directory contains many different subdirectories that contain
configuration, campaign, and other associated files to run simulations that represent real-world
scenarios. Within the each subdirectory, there is usually a single campaign file (campaign.json),
though some directories also include a campaign overlay file (campaign_overrides.json), which has
been created by combining campaign_overrides.json with one of the default files in
`Regression/defaults`_. The naming of these files is an arbitrary convention used at |IDM_s|;
you may name this files anything you choose. See :doc:`howto-campaign-overlay` for more information
flattening two campaign files.

Although you can create campaign files entirely from scratch, it is often easier to start from an
existing campaign file and modify it to meet your needs. The simplest method is to edit the
parameters or parameter values in the JSON file in any text editor. You may also create or modify
the files using a scripting language, as with configuration files. See :doc:`howto-configuration`
for examples.

The following is an example of campaign file that has two events (SimpleVaccine and Outbreak) that
occur in all nodes at day 1 and day 30, respectively. Each event contains an event coordinator that
describes who receives the intervention (everyone, with the vaccine repeated three times) and the
configuration for the intervention itself. Note that the nested JSON elements have been organized to
best illustrate their hierarchy, but that many files in the Regression directory list the parameters
and nested objects differently.

   :language: json
   :lines: 1, 2, 4-7, 9-36, 38-59

.. lines is included here to remove the VACCINATION labels that are used for the overlay file

Multiple interventions
======================

When creating multiple interventions, either of the same type or different types, they will
generally be distributed independently without regard to whether a person has already received another
intervention.

.. include:: ../reuse/warning-outbreak.txt

For example, say you create two **SimpleBednet** interventions and both interventions
have **Demographic_Coverage** set to 0.5 (50% demographic coverage). This value is the probability
that each individual in the target population will receive the intervention. It does not guarantee
that the exact fraction of the target population set by **Demographic_Coverage** receives the
intervention.

By default, each individual in the simulation will have a 50% chance of receiving a bednet in both
of the distributions and the two distributions will be independent. Therefore, each individual has a
75% chance of receiving at least one bednet.
