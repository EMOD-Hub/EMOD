Input data file structure
=========================

The :term:`input data files` described in this section determine the demographics, migration, climate, and other
relatively fixed information about the population within each geographic node. These files are in
contrast to the population, geographic, and migration parameters in the :term:`configuration file`
that control simulation-wide qualities, such as enabling air migration across all nodes in the
simulation.

Generally, you will download and use input data files without modification. For instructions, see
:doc:`howto-inputs`. However, demographics files can include many user-defined parameter values and
will likely require modification. Only the demographics file is required for a simulation.

Each type of input data generally requires both a metadata file that contains provenance information
and a binary file that contains the actual data for each node. Some input files included with
|EMOD_s| were prepared using CIESIN Gridded Population of the World (GPW) population distribution
and a corresponding spatial resolution grid (for example, 2.5 arc minutes) to define the initial
population and extent of the nodes for country-wide input files. Therefore, the naming convention
for this files usually leads with the geographic location, followed by the spatial resolution, and
input file type.

All input files include the parameter **IdReference** in the metadata, which is used to generate the
**NodeID** associated with each node in a simulation. The values for **IdReference** and **NodeID**
must be the same across all input data files used in a simulation. See :doc:`parameter-demographics`
for more information about **NodeID** generation.
