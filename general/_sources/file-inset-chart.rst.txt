Inset chart output report
=========================

The inset chart output report is output with every simulation. It is a JSON-formatted file with the
:term:`channel` output results of the simulation, consisting of simulation-wide averages
by time step. The channels in an inset chart are fully specified by the simulation type and cannot
be altered without making changes to the |EMOD_s| source code. The file name is InsetChart.json. You
can use the information contained in the file to create a chart, but |EMOD_s| does not automatically
output a chart.

The file contains a header and a channels section.

Header
======

The header section contains the following parameters.

.. csv-table::
   :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
   :widths: 8, 5, 10

   DateTime, string, The time stamp indicating when the report was generated.
   DTK_Version, string, The version of |EMOD_s| used.
   Report_Type, string, The type of output report.
   Report_Version, string, The format version of the report.
   Start_Time, integer, The time noted in days when the simulation begins.
   Simulation_Timestep, integer, The number of days in each time step.
   Timesteps, integer, The number of time steps in this simulation.
   Channels, integer, The number of channels in the simulation.


Channels
========

The channels section contains the following parameters.

.. csv-table::
   :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
   :widths: 8, 5, 10

   <Channel_Title>, string, The title of the particular channel.
   Units, string, The units used for this channel.
   Data, array, A list of the channel data at each time step.

Example
=======

The following is a sample of an InsetChart.json file.
