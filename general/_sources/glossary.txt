Glossary
========

The |EMOD_l| glossary is divided into the following subsections that define terms related to software
usage, general epidemiology, and the particular disease being modeled.

.. I think it's preferable to define terms as "long form (acronym)" rather than just the acronym.
.. We don't want to link to the glossary entry after the first use anyway. Additionally, it's better
.. to use a singular term in the glossary, unless that term is almost always used in its plural form.

Software terms
==============

The following terms are used to describe both general computing processes and concepts and the files,
features, and functionality related to running simulations with |EMOD_l|.

.. glossary::

    agent-based model
        A type of simulation that models the actions and interactions of autonomous agents
        (both individual and collective entities such as organizations or groups).

    Boost
        Free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source libraries aimed at a wide range of uses including
        parallel processing applications (Boost.MPI). For more information, please see the Boost
        website, http://www.boost.org.

    boxcar function
        A mathematical function that is equal to zero over the entire real line except for a single
        interval where it is equal to a constant.

    campaign
        A collection of events that use interventions to modify a :term:`simulation`.

    campaign event
        A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign.

    campaign file
        A :term:`JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` formatted file that contains the parameters that
        specify the distribution instructions for all interventions used in a campaign, such as
        diagnostic tests, the target demographic, and the timing and cost of interventions. The
        location of this file is specified in the :term:`configuration file` with the
        **Campaign_Filename** parameter. Typically, the file name is campaign.json.

    channel
        A property of the simulation (for example, "Parasite Prevalence") that is accumulated once per
        simulated :term:`time step` and written to file, typically as an array of the accumulated values.

    class factory
        A function that instantiate objects at run-time and use information
        from JSON-based configuration information in the creation of these objects.

    configuration file
        A :term:`JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` formatted file that contains the parameters
        sufficient for initiating a simulation. It controls many different aspects of the
        simulation, such as population size, disease dynamics, and length of the simulation.
        Typically, the file name is config.json.

    core
        In computing, a core refers to an independent central processing unit (CPU) in the computer.
        Multi-core computers have more than one CPU. However, through technologies such as Hyper-
        Threading Technology (HTT or HT), a single physical core can actually act like two virtual
        or logical cores, and appear to the operating system as two processors.

    demographics file
        A :term:`JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` formatted file that contains the parameters that
        specify the demographics of a population, such as age distribution, risk, birthrate, and more.
        |IDM_s| provides demographics files for many geographic regions. This file is considered part of the
        :term:`input data files` and is typically named <region>_demographics.json.

    disease-specific build
        A build of the |exe_l| built using SCons without any dynamic link libraries (DLLs).

    dynamic link library (DLL)
        Microsoft's implementation of a shared library, separate from the |exe_l|, that can be
        dynamically loaded (and unloaded when unneeded) at runtime. This loading can be explicit or
        implicit.

    EMODule
        A modular component of |EMOD_s| that are consumed and used by the |exe_l|.
        Under Windows, a |module| is implemented as a :term:`dynamic link library (DLL)` and,
        under |Centos|, |modules| are currently not supported. |modules| are primarily custom reporters.

    Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD)
        The modeling software from the |IDM_l| for disease researchers and developers to investigate
        disease dynamics, and to assist in combating a host of infectious diseases. You may see
        this referred to as Disease Transmission Kernel (DTK) in the source code.

    Eradication.exe
        Typical (default) name for the |exe_l|, whether built using monolithic build or
        modular (|module|-enabled) build.

    event coordinator
        A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign.

    flattened file
        A single campaign or configuration file created by combining a default file with one or more
        overlay files. Multiple files must be flattened prior to running a simulation. Configuration
        files are flattened to a single-depth JSON file without nesting, the format required for
        consumption by the |exe_l|. Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily
        used for testing and experimentation.

    Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT)
         A feature for modeling person-to-person transmission of diseases in heterogeneous population
         segments within a node for generic simulations.

    high-performance computing (HPC)
        The use of parallel processing for running advanced applications efficiently, reliably,
        and quickly.

    input data files
        Fixed information used as input to a simulation. Examples of such data are population,
        altitude, demographics, and transportation migrations. The configurable config.json and
        campaign.json files do not fall into this category of static fixed input.

    intervention
        An object aimed at reducing the spread of a disease that is distributed either to an
        individual; such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet; or to a node; such as a larvicide. Additionally,
        initial disease outbreaks and intermediate interventions that schedule another intervention
        are implemented as interventions in the :term:`campaign file`.

    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
        A human-readable, open standard, text-based file format for data interchange. It is
        typically used to represent simple data structures and associative arrays, and is language-
        independent.

    Keyhole Markup Language (KML)
        A file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser, for example, Google Maps.
        The format uses an XML-based structure (tag-based structure with nested elements and
        attributes). Tags are case-sensitive.

    Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG)
        A method for the linker to optimize code (for size and/or speed) after compilation has
        occurred. The compiled code is turned not into actual code, but instead into an intermediate
        language form (IL, but not to be confused with .NET IL which has a different purpose). The
        LTCG then, unlike the compiler, can see the whole body of code in all object files and be
        able to optimize the result more effectively.

    Message Passing Interface (MPI)
        An interface used to pass information between computing cores in parallel simulations. One
        example is the migration of individuals from one geographic location to another within |EMOD_s|
        simulations.

    microsolver
        A microsolver is a type of "miniature model" that operates within the framework of |EMOD_s|
        to compute a particular set of parameters. Each microsolver, in effect, is creating a
        microsimulation in order to accurately capture the dynamics of that particular aspect of the
        model.


    Monte Carlo
        Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a class of computational algorithms
        utilizing repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo simulations create
        probability distributions for possible outcome values, which provides a more realistic way of
        describing uncertainty in variables.

    monolithic build
        A single |exe_l| with no DLLs that includes all components as part of |exe_s| itself. You
        can still use |modules| with the monolithic build; for example, a
        custom reporter is a common type of |module|. View the documentation on |modules| and
        emodules_map.json for more information about creation and use of |modules|.

    node
        A grid size that is used for modeling geographies. Within |EMOD_s|, a node is a geographic
        region containing simulated individuals. Individuals migrate between nodes either
        temporarily or permanently using mobility patterns driven by local, regional, and long-
        distance transportation.

    node-targeted intervention
        An intervention that is distributed to a geographical node rather than to a single
        individual. One example is larvicides, which affect all mosquitoes living and feeding within
        a given node.

    output report
        A file that is the output from an |EMOD_s| simulation. Output reports are in JSON, CSV, or binary
        file format. You must pass the data from an output report to graphing software if you want to
        visualize the output of a simulation.

    overlay file
        An additional configuration, campaign, or demographic file that overrides the default
        parameter values in the primary file. Separating the parameters into multiple files is
        primarily used for testing a nd experimentation. In the case of configuration and campaign
        files, the files can use an arbitrary hierarchical structure to organize parameters into
        logical groups. Configuration and campaign files must be flattened into a single file before
        running a simulation.

    preview
        Software that undergoes a shorter testing cycle in order to make it available
        more quickly. Previews may contain software defects that could result in unexpected
        behavior. Use |EMOD_s| previews at your own discretion.

    regression test
        A test to verify that existing |EMOD_s| functionality works with new
        updates, typically used to refer to one of a set of scenarios included in the |EMOD_s|
        bundle  and located in the Regression subdirectory of the bundle. Directory names of each
        subdirectory  in Regression describe the main regression attributes, for example,
        "1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNode". Also can refer to the process of regression testing of
        software.

    release
        Software that includes new functionality, scientific tutorials leveraging new or existing
        functionality, and/or bug fixes that have been thoroughly tested so that any defects have
        been fixed before release. |EMOD_s| releases undergo full regression testing.

    reporter
        Functionality that extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and saves it as an
        :term:`output report`. |EMOD_s| provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from
        simulations and you also have the ability to create a custom reporter.

    scenario
        A collection of input, configuration, and campaign files that describes a real-world
        example of a disease outbreak and interventions. Many scenarios are included with |EMOD_s|
        source installations or are available in the Regression directory of the EMOD GitHub repository.
        The tutorials describe how to run simulations using these scenarios to learn more about
        epidemiology and disease modeling.

    schema
        A text or JSON file that can be generated from the |exe_l| that defines all
        configuration and campaign parameters.

    simulation
        An |EMOD_s| software execution performed by the kernel. Each simulation has an associated
        set of files that control the inputs, configuration, and campaign.

    simulation type
        The disease or disease class to model.

        .. include:: ../reuse/sim-types.txt

    solvers
        Solvers are used to find computational solutions to problems. In simulations, they can be used,
        for example, to determine the time of the next simulation step, or to compute the states of
        a model at particular time steps.

    Standard Template Library (STL)
        A library that contains a set of common C++ classes (including generic algorithms and data
        structures) that are independent of container and implemented as templates, which enables
        compile-time polymorphism (often more efficient than run-time polymorphism). For more
        information and discussion of STL, see `Wikipedia`_.

    state transition event
        A change in state (e.g. healthy to infected, undiagnosed to positive diagnosis, or birth)
        that may trigger a subsequent action, often an intervention. "Campaign events" should not be
        confused with state transition events.

    time step
        A discrete number of hours or days in which the "simulation states" of all "simulation
        objects" (interventions, infections, immune systems, or individuals) are updated in a
        simulation. Each time step will complete processing before launching the next one. For
        example, a time step would process the migration data for populations moving between nodes
        via rail, airline, and road. The migration of individuals between nodes is the last step of
        the time step after updating states.

    tutorial
        A set of instructions in the documentation to learn more about epidemiology and
        disease modeling. Tutorials are based on real-world scenarios and demonstrate the mechanics
        of the the model. Each tutorial consists of one or more scenarios.

    working directory
        The directory that contains the configuration and campaign files for a simulation. You must
        be in this directory when you invoke |exe_s| at the command line to run a simulation.

Epidemiology terms
==================

The following terms are used to describe general concepts and processes in the field of epidemiology
and disease modeling.

.. glossary::

    antigen
        A substance that is capable of inducing a specific immune response and that evokes the
        production of one or more antibodies.

    Clausius-Clayperon relation
        A way of characterizing a transition between two phases of matter; provides a method to find
        a relationship between temperature and pressure along phase boundaries. Frequently used in
        meteorology and climatology to describe the behavior of water vapor. See `Wikipedia -
        Clausius-Clayperon relation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation>`__
        for more information.

    deterministic
        Characterized by the output being fully determined by the parameter values and the initial
        conditions. Given the same inputs, a deterministic model will always produce the same output.

    diffusive migration
        The diffusion of people in and out of nearby nodes by foot travel.

    epitope
        The portion of an antigen that the immune system recognizes. An epitope is also called an
        antigenic determinant.

    Euler method
        Used in mathematics and computational science, this method is a first-order numerical
        procedure for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value.

    exp(
        The exponential function, :math:`e^x`, where :math:`e` is the number (approximately 2.718281828)
        such that the function :math:`e^x` is its own derivative. The exponential function is used to
        model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same
        proportional change (i.e. percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. The
        function is often written as :math:`exp(x)`. The graph of :math:`y = exp(x)` is upward-sloping
        and increases faster as :math:`x` increases.

    herd immunity
        The resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a
        sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune to the disease, especially through
        vaccination.

    incidence
        The rate of new cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of
        the risk of contracting a disease.

    Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification System
        A system based on the concept that native vegetation is a good expression of climate. Thus,
        climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind. It combines
        average annual and monthly temperatures and precipitation, and the seasonality of
        precipitation. |EMOD_s| has several options for configuring the climate, namely air
        temperature, rainfall, and humidity. One option utilizes Input Files that associate
        geographic nodes with Koppen climate indices. The modified Koppen classification uses three
        letters to divide the world into five major climate regions (A, B, C, D, and E) based on
        average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly
        temperature. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on temperature and
        precipitation. While the Koppen system does not take such things as temperature extremes,
        average cloud cover, number of days with sunshine, or wind into account, it is a good
        representation of our earth's climate.

    loss to follow-up (LTFU)
        Patients who at one point were actively participating in disease treatment or clinical
        research, but have become lost either by error or by becoming unreachable at the point of
        follow-up.

    ordinary differential equation (ODE)
        A differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and
        its derivatives.

    prevalence
        The rate of all cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of how
        widespread a disease is.

    reproductive number
        In a fully susceptible population, the basic reproductive number R\ :sub:0\ is the number of
        new cases generated by one infectious case over the course of the infectious period. The
        effective reproductive number takes into account non-susceptible individuals.


    routine immunization (RI)
        The standard practice of vaccinating the majority of susceptible people in a population against
        vaccine-preventable diseases.

    scenario
        A real-world or hypothetical situation that demonstrates or represents disease dynamics.

    stochastic
        Characterized by having a random probability distribution that may be analyzed statistically
        but not predicted precisely.

    subpatent
        When an individual is infected but asymptomatic, so the infection is not readily detectable.

    SEIR model
        A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
        of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
        following five states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered.

    SEIRS model
        A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
        of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
        following five states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and susceptible.

    SI model
        A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
        of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
        following five states: susceptible and infectious.

    SIR model
        A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
        of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
        following five states: susceptible, infectious, and recovered.

    SIRS model
        A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
        of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
        following five states: susceptible, infectious, recovered, and susceptible.

    SIS model
        A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
        of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
        following five states: susceptible, infectious, and susceptible.

    supplemental immunization activity (SIA)
        In contrast to :term:`routine immunization (RI)`, SIAs are large-scale operations with a
        goal of delivering vaccines to every household.

    WAIFW matrix
        A matrix of values that describes the rate of transmission between different population
        groups. WAIFW is an abbrevation for Who Acquires Infection From Whom.

    Weibull distribution
        A probability distribution often used in |EMOD_s| and that requires both a shape parameter
        and a scale parameter. The shape parameter governs the shape of the density function. When
        the shape parameter is equal to 1, it is an exponential distribution. For shape parameters
        above 1, it forms a unimodal (hump-shaped) density function. As the shape parameter becomes
        large, the function forms a sharp peak. The inverse of the shape parameter is sometimes
        referred to here as the “heterogeneity” of the distribution (heterogeneity = 1/shape),
        because it can be helpful to think about the degree of heterogeneity of draws from the
        distribution, especially for hump-shaped functions with heterogeneity values between 0 and 1
        (i.e., shape parameters greater than 1). The scale parameter shifts the distribution from
        left to right. When heterogeneity is small (i.e., the shape parameter is large), the scale
        parameter sets the location of the sharp peak.

    Malaria and vector terms
    ========================

    The following terms are used to describe the biological processes involved in malaria and other
    vector-borne diseases.

    .. glossary::

        circumsporozoite protein (CSP)
            One of two proteins (the other being thrombospondin-related adhesive protein) involved in
            sporozoite recognition of host cells in malaria.

        cohort model
            A vector model that tracks properties of mosquito "cohorts", for example, population, age,
            gender, fertility, etc.

        cytokine
            Cytokines are small secreted proteins that are released by cells, and have specific effects
            on interactions and communications between cells. They are especially important in the immune
            system, and can function in inflammatory (and anti-inflammatory) response.

        CRISPR
            A genome-editing technique that utilizes the CRISPR/Cas9 system (a prokaryotic immune system)
            that can be used to splice DNA sequences in very specific target locations,  enabling the
            precise insertion or removal of genes of interest.

        entomological inoculation rate (EIR)
            The commonly-used measure of the intensity of malaria transmission. EIR is equal to the number
            of mosquito bites per night times the proportion of those bites that test positive for sporozoites.

        gametocyte
            The male and female sexual forms of the blood-stage malaria parasite. During blood-feeding,
            gametocytes are taken up into the mosquito mid-gut where they commence the mosquito-phase of
            the parasite life cycle.

        gene drive mosquito
            Gene drive is a genetic technique that promotes the inheritance of particular genes or specific
            genetic elements.  In mosquitoes, approaches are being tested that work to suppress the spread
            of malaria by creating mosquito lines through fertility suppression, driving-Y chromosomes,
            or express genes that limit malaria transmission.

        gonotrophic
            A female mosquito's feeding and egg-laying cycle, where the duration is defined as the average
            number of days that gravid mosquitoes take to oviposit after taking a blood meal.

        hepatocyte
           The cell type that comprises liver tissue.

        homing endonuclease gene (HEG)
            A "selfish" genetic element that can spread through the mosquito population even at a cost to
            the host. The HEG allele status is a tracked property of mosquitoes. Large numbers of HEG-
            positive mosquitoes may be introduced into the simulation by a **MosquitoRelease**
            intervention.

        individual mosquito model
            A vector model simulation where every individual mosquito in the population is modeled, as
            well as a simulation of a sampled subset of mosquitoes to represent the population as the
            whole.

        indoor residual spraying (IRS)
            The process of spraying insecticide on the interior surfaces of dwellings in order to repel
            or kill mosquitoes.

        insecticide-treated nets (ITN)
            Bednets hung over sleeping areas that are treated with insecticide to repel mosquitoes
            and kill those that land on them.

        larval habitat
            Mosquito larval ecology includes several habitat types including brackish swamp, constant,
            human population, temporary rainfall, and semi-permanent water vegetation.

        larvicide
            A node-targeted intervention that may be configured to have a direct killing effect on the
            larval population and a temporary reduction on available larval habitat.

        mass drug administration (MDA)
           The treatment of an entire population in a geographic area with a
           curative dose of an antimalarial drug without first testing for infection, and regardless of
           the presence of symptoms.

        merozoite
            The malaria parasite stage that invades red blood cells. After each cycle of asexual
            reproduction within the infected red blood cell, merozoites are released into the
            bloodstream to invade new red blood cells.

        merozoites
            see "merozoite"

        merozoite surface protein (MSP)
            A type of protein integral to red blood cell invasion by malaria parasites that is an important
            target of the human immune response.

        oviposition
            to deposit or lay eggs.

        pre-erythrocytic
            Stages of a malaria parasite that occur before the red blood cells are invaded. This
            includes the period starting from inoculation with sporozoites, through the liver-stage
            multiplication, up to infected hepatocyte rupture, and the first invasion of erythrocytes by
            merozoites.

        pre-erythrocytic vaccine (PEV)
            A vaccine targeted at the earliest stage of malaria parasite development, namely before the
            blood-stage infection. Other vaccines target the asexual and sexual stages of the parasite.

        Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)
            A protein encoded by the malaria parasite and expressed on the surface of infected red blood
            cells. PfEMP1 adheres to various human receptors, allowing sequestration of parasitized red
            blood cells and avoidance of clearance in the spleen. PfEMP1 is an important antigenic
            target of the human adapted immune response. It exhibits a high degree of antigenic
            variation via a genetic switching mechanism evolved to escape immune pressure.

        schizont
            Cells formed during the asexual stage of the life cycle of sporozoan protozoans, such as the
            malaria parasite.

        spatial repellent
            An intervention that may be individually-distributed (protective indoors and outdoors), or
            node-distributed at the community-level, that repels mosquitoes from biting.

        sporogony
            The asexual process of spore formation in parasitic sporozoans.

        sporozoite
            a motile, spore-like stage of the malaria parasite that is the infectious agent introduced
            into the host.

        sugar-baited trap
            Bait stations, often placed inside houses, that have an attractive and toxic sugar used to
            attract and kill sugar-feeding male and female mosquitoes.

        superinfection
            The simultaneous infection with multiple strains of the same pathogen.

        transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV)
            A vaccine that blocks gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in
            mosquitoes. Also referred to as a "sexual-stage" vaccine, since vaccines in this class block
            gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in mosquitoes.

        vaccine intervention types
            In |EMOD_s|, vaccine intervention types are either "AcquisitionBlocking",
            "TransmissionBlocking" or "MortalityBlocking". For example, "mode-of-action", "targeted
            parasite stages", (such as pre-erythrocytic, asexual, or sexual), etc.

        vector
            Insect or other living carrier that transmits an infectious agent. The vector life cycle and
            feeding cycle in the model are described in the article `Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011,
            10:303`_.

        vectorial capacity
            The daily rate of all mosquitoes that would be infected after biting a single infectious host.
            This measure can be used to describe the transmission intensity of malaria, and serves as a
            rate at which future infections arise from a currently infected host.

        vector model
            The vector model includes both a :term:`cohort model` and an :term:`individual mosquito model`. The
            model is a closed-loop feeding cycle where successful animal feeds (both indoors and
            outdoors) produce eggs, larva, vector mating, and then, adult mosquitoes. The vector model
            inherits the same human- infection model structure from the generic simulation type:
            uninfected, latent incubation, infectious, multiple immune variables, and superinfection.
            However, the transmission of infections is not between individual humans, but rather via the
            human-to-vector and vector- to-human pathways.

        Wolbachia
            This is a genus of bacteria that infects many arthopod species (especially insects). It has
            been discovered that insects infected with Wolbachia  have increased resistance to viral
            or other parasitic infections. Work is underway to determine if strains of modified Wolbachia
            can be used to control malaria, by effectively preventing mosquitoes from becoming
            infected with  *Plasmodium* parasites.
