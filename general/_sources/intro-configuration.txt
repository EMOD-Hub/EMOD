==================
Configuration file
==================

The primary means of configuring the disease simulation is the :term:`configuration file`. This
required file is a :term:`JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` formatted file that is typically named
config.json. The configuration file controls many different aspects of the simulation. For example,

* The names of the :term:`campaign file` and :term:`input data files` to use
* Simulation-wide demographics, climate, and migration data
* General disease attributes such as infectivity, immunity, mortality, and so on
* Attributes specific to the disease type being modeled, including treatment efficacy
* The reports to output from the simulation


|IDM_s| provides complete simulation scenarios in the Regression_ directory
on GitHub. Within each of the simulation subdirectories, there is a config.json file. The
Scenarios subdirectory contains the files used in the tutorials.

.. _Regression: https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD/tree/master/Regression


The following is an example of configuration file.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/howto-generic-config-flat-full.json
   :language: json

Overlay file
==============

As you work more with |EMOD_s|, you may want to change the values of a view parameters of interest
while keeping the rest constant, for example, when running simulation experiments or testing source
code changes.

You have the option of creating an :term:`overlay file` to keep configuration parameters of
interest in a separate file from the complete configuration file that contains default values. These
files can be flattened into a single file and the values in the overlay file will override those
in the default file.


See :doc:`parameter-configuration` for a comprehensive list and description of all parameters
available to use in the configuration file for this simulation type.
