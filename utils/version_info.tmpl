// --- DanB 10/28/2024 - I changed utils\ProgVersion::updateVersionString() to only include
// --- the Major and minor version numbers because revision and build aren't getting
// --- populated like they used to.  I'm keeping everything here incase we enable them again.
// ---
// --- We should update the MINOR_VERSION every time we make a release.  We will update the
// --- MAJOR_VERSION when we have changed something very significant like change the malaria
// --- or HIV intra-host model (something changing the science significantly) or a major 
// --- change to the processing (i.e. don't loop over each node and each human in each node.').
// ---
// --- We are NOT doing Semantic Versioning because we have not been doing that for the last
// --- 9 years.  For much of those years, we have had a version number to define a certain
// --- baseline version of the code, but used the branch and commit hash as the real version.
// --- Keeping it at two digits will keep us connected to past versions, but updating the 
// --- number and releasing it with a new emodpy-XXX will still be a huge improvement.
// ---
// --- VERSIONING RULES 10/29/2024
// ---
// --- When creating a new version, please log the big things that changed so that we can easily
// --- remember what has changed and when.  This is developer facing information, not user
// --- facing info.
// ---
// --- MAJOR_VERSION - Change when something very significant changes like the malaria
// ---                 or HIV intra-host model (something changing the science significantly)
// ---                 or a major change to the processing (i.e. don't loop over each node
// ---                 and each human in each node.').  Set by developer.
// ---
// --- MINOR_VERSION - Change every time we make a release.  Every time we make an EMOD
// ---                 release we should be making an emodpy-XXX release.  An EMOD bug fix
// ---                 that has not interface/input/output changes could be just a minor
// ---                 emodpy-XXX version change.  If we add a "minor" feature to EMOD, this
// ---                 may cause a major version change to emodpy-XXX if it breaks existing
// ---                 code.  If the emodpy-XXX code can be updated such that people can get
// ---                 the new version of EMOD and user their existing emodpy-XXX code, then
// ---                 emodpy-XXX can have a minor version change.  Set by developer.
// ---
// --- REVISION_NUMBER - Ignored at this time.  Used to be the number of commits in the repo
// ---                 for the given branch, but for build performance reasons, we only download
// ---                 the files for the last commit.  Hence, the number of commits/revision
// ---                 is always one.  Set by scripts, but ignored.
// ---
// --- BUILD_NUMBER -  Ignored at this time.  I don't remember us ever using this value.
// ---                 I can't find anything setting right now.  Not set.
// ---
// --- BUILDER_NAME -  This is the user name of the person building EMOD. Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- BUILD_DATE -    The data and time that the code is being compiled.  Set by compiler.
// ---
// --- BRANCH -        The name of the branch in git.  Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- HASH -          The short commit hash value of the commit in git.  The branch and the
// ---                 has allow the user to get the exact version of code.
// ---                 THE BRANCH AND HASH ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE VERSIONING.
// ---                 IT IS CRITICAL THAT THEY ARE CORRECT AND FINDABLE IN GITHUB!!!
// ---                 Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- SCCS_BRANCH -   Combination of branch and commit hash.  Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- SCCS_DATE -     The data of the commit indicated by the hash.  Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- ============= Scripts Used in Versioning ===============
// ---
// --- utils\SConstruct - This is the SCons build script for building the utils library.
// ---                 In addition to building the library, the file also contains logic to
// ---                 extract git information and set compiler directives for SCCS_BRANCH,
// ---                 SCCS_DATE, BUILDER_NAME, and REVISION_NUMBER.  It copies this file to
// ---                 version_info.h and then relies on the compiler directives to set the
// ---                 values.  Used only for Linux builds.
// ---
// --- Scripts\gitversion.cmd - A Windows build will use this file via a Pre-Build Event in
// ---                 the utils.vs.proj file or is called from the utils\SConstruct file
// ---                 when doing a Windows build via SCons.  This script will get the git
// ---                 information and create a version_info.h file that has the REVISION,
// ---                 BRANCH, HASH, DATE, and BUILDER replaced with the values from git.
// ---
// --- NOTE: version_info.h is created during a build and should not be checked in.
