// --- We should update the MINOR_VERSION every time we make a release.  We will update the
// --- MAJOR_VERSION when we have changed something very significant like change the malaria
// --- or HIV intra-host model (something changing the science significantly) or a major 
// --- change to the processing (i.e. don't loop over each node and each human in each node.').
// ---
// --- VERSIONING RULES
// ---
// --- When creating a new version, please log the big things that changed so that we can easily
// --- remember what has changed and when. This is developer facing information, not user
// --- facing info.
// ---
// --- MAJOR_VERSION - Change when something very significant changes like the malaria
// ---                 or HIV intra-host model (something changing the science significantly)
// ---                 or a major change to the processing (i.e. don't loop over each node
// ---                 and each human in each node.'). Set by developer.
// ---
// --- MINOR_VERSION - Change every time we make a release. Every time we make an EMOD
// ---                 release we should be making an emodpy-XXX release. An EMOD bug fix
// ---                 that has not interface/input/output changes could be just a minor
// ---                 emodpy-XXX version change. If we add a "minor" feature to EMOD, this
// ---                 may cause a major version change to emodpy-XXX if it breaks existing
// ---                 code. If the emodpy-XXX code can be updated such that people can get
// ---                 the new version of EMOD and user their existing emodpy-XXX code, then
// ---                 emodpy-XXX can have a minor version change. Set by developer.
// ---
// --- REVISION_NUMBER - Number of commits since previous minor version increment. Requires
// ---                   correctly set tags using the format "vX.Y" for X=MAJOR_VERSION and
// ---                   for Y=MINOR_VERSION. Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- BUILDER_NAME -  This is the user name of the person building EMOD. Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- BUILD_DATE -    The data and time that the code is being compiled. Set by compiler.
// ---
// --- BRANCH -        The name of the branch in git. Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- HASH -          The short commit hash value of the commit in git. The branch and the
// ---                 has allow the user to get the exact version of code.
// ---                 THE BRANCH AND HASH ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE VERSIONING.
// ---                 IT IS CRITICAL THAT THEY ARE CORRECT AND FINDABLE IN GITHUB!!!
// ---                 Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- SCCS_BRANCH -   Combination of branch and commit hash. Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- SCCS_DATE -     The data of the commit indicated by the hash. Set via the scripts.
// ---
// --- ============= Scripts Used in Versioning ===============
// ---
// --- utils\SConstruct - SCons build script for building the utils library. Most important.
// ---                    In addition to building the library, the file also contains logic to
// ---                    extract git information and set compiler directives for SCCS_BRANCH,
// ---                    SCCS_DATE, BUILDER_NAME, and REVISION_NUMBER. It copies this file to
// ---                    version_info.h and then relies on the compiler directives to set the
// ---                    values.
// ---
// --- Scripts\gitversion.cmd - Visual Studio uses these files via a Pre-Build Event in the
//     Scripts\gitversion.js    utils.vs.proj file. Scripts will get the git information
// ---                          and create a version_info.h file that has the REVISION, BRANCH
// ---                          HASH, DATE, and BUILDER replaced with the values from git.
// ---
// --- NOTE: version_info.h is created during a build and should not be checked in.
