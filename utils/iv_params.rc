The coordinator does not expire until the **Duration** has expired. The list can be empty. The events contained in the list are defined in **Custom_Coordinator_Events** in the simulation configuration file."
#define VSEC_Survey_Completed_Event_DESC_TEXT "Optional Coordinator-level event that will be sent out every time VectorSurveillanceEventCoordinator surveys the vector population."
#define WE_Initial_Effect_DESC_TEXT "The initial efficacy of the effect.  The efficacy of the effect will changes from this value depending on the effect.  For one of the WaningEffectBoxXXX's, this will be the value during the efficacy of the effect during the **Box_Duration**.  For one of the WaningEffectMapXXX's, the value acts as a multiplier used to define the magnitude of the shape of the curve defined in the effect."
#define WEB_Box_Duration_DESC_TEXT "The box duration of the effect in days."
#define WEC_Add_Effects_DESC_TEXT "The **Add_Effects** parameter allows you to combine multiple effects from the waning effect classes. If set to true (1), then the waning effect values from the different waning effect objects are added together. If set to false (0), the waning effect values are multiplied. The resulting waning effect value must be greater than 1."

#define WEC_Expires_When_All_Expire_DESC_TEXT "If set to true (1), then all of the effects, as specified in the **Effect_List** parameter, must expire for the efficacy of the intervention to expire. If set to false (0), then the efficacy of the intervention will expire as soon as one of the parameters expires."
#define WEE_Decay_Time_Constant_DESC_TEXT "The exponential decay length, in days.  The current effect is initialized with **Initial_Effect** and it is updated each time step as 'current_effect *= (1 - dt/**Decay_Time_Constant**)' (dt equal to delta time)."
#define WEM_Durability_Map_DESC_TEXT "The time, in days, since the intervention was distributed and a multiplier for the **Initial_Effect**."

#define WEM_Reference_Timer_DESC_TEXT "The timestamp at which linear-map should be anchored."
#define WERB_Expected_Discard_Time_DESC_TEXT "The mean time, in days, of an exponential distribution of the duration of the effect of an intervention (such as a vaccine or bed net). Specify how this effect decays over time using one of the :doc:`parameter-campaign-waningeffects`."
