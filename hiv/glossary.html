<p>The following terms are used to describe both general computing processes and concepts and the files,
features, and functionality related to running simulations with Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD).</p>
<dl class="glossary docutils">
<dt id="term-agent-based-model">agent-based model</dt>
<dd>A type of simulation that models the actions and interactions of autonomous agents
(both individual and collective entities such as organizations or groups).</dd>
<dt id="term-boost">Boost</dt>
<dd>Free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source libraries aimed at a wide range of uses including
parallel processing applications (Boost.MPI). For more information, please see the Boost
website, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-boxcar-function">boxcar function</dt>
<dd>A mathematical function that is equal to zero over the entire real line except for a single
interval where it is equal to a constant.</dd>
<dt id="term-campaign">campaign</dt>
<dd>A collection of events that use interventions to modify a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-simulation"><span class="xref std std-term">simulation</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-campaign-event">campaign event</dt>
<dd>A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign.</dd>
<dt id="term-campaign-file">campaign file</dt>
<dd>A <a class="reference internal" href="#term-javascript-object-notation-json"><span class="xref std std-term">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</span></a> formatted file that contains the parameters that
specify the distribution instructions for all interventions used in a campaign, such as
diagnostic tests, the target demographic, and the timing and cost of interventions. The
location of this file is specified in the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-configuration-file"><span class="xref std std-term">configuration file</span></a> with the
<strong>Campaign_Filename</strong> parameter. Typically, the file name is campaign.json.</dd>
<dt id="term-channel">channel</dt>
<dd>A property of the simulation (for example, &#8220;Parasite Prevalence&#8221;) that is accumulated once per
simulated <a class="reference internal" href="#term-time-step"><span class="xref std std-term">time step</span></a> and written to file, typically as an array of the accumulated values.</dd>
<dt id="term-class-factory">class factory</dt>
<dd>A function that instantiate objects at run-time and use information
from JSON-based configuration information in the creation of these objects.</dd>
<dt id="term-configuration-file">configuration file</dt>
<dd>A <a class="reference internal" href="#term-javascript-object-notation-json"><span class="xref std std-term">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</span></a> formatted file that contains the parameters
sufficient for initiating a simulation. It controls many different aspects of the
simulation, such as population size, disease dynamics, and length of the simulation.
Typically, the file name is config.json.</dd>
<dt id="term-core">core</dt>
<dd>In computing, a core refers to an independent central processing unit (CPU) in the computer.
Multi-core computers have more than one CPU. However, through technologies such as Hyper-
Threading Technology (HTT or HT), a single physical core can actually act like two virtual
or logical cores, and appear to the operating system as two processors.</dd>
<dt id="term-demographics-file">demographics file</dt>
<dd>A <a class="reference internal" href="#term-javascript-object-notation-json"><span class="xref std std-term">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</span></a> formatted file that contains the parameters that
specify the demographics of a population, such as age distribution, risk, birthrate, and more.
IDM provides demographics files for many geographic regions. This file is considered part of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-input-data-files"><span class="xref std std-term">input data files</span></a> and is typically named &lt;region&gt;_demographics.json.</dd>
<dt id="term-disease-specific-build">disease-specific build</dt>
<dd>A build of the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) built using SCons without any dynamic link libraries (DLLs).</dd>
<dt id="term-dynamic-link-library-dll">dynamic link library (DLL)</dt>
<dd>Microsoft&#8217;s implementation of a shared library, separate from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), that can be
dynamically loaded (and unloaded when unneeded) at runtime. This loading can be explicit or
implicit.</dd>
<dt id="term-emodule">EMODule</dt>
<dd>A modular component of EMOD that are consumed and used by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe).
Under Windows, a EMODule is implemented as a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-dynamic-link-library-dll"><span class="xref std std-term">dynamic link library (DLL)</span></a> and,
under CentOS on Azure, EMODules are currently not supported. EMODules are primarily custom reporters.</dd>
<dt id="term-epidemiological-modeling-software-emod">Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD)</dt>
<dd>The modeling software from the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) for disease researchers and developers to investigate
disease dynamics, and to assist in combating a host of infectious diseases. You may see
this referred to as Disease Transmission Kernel (DTK) in the source code.</dd>
<dt id="term-eradication-exe">Eradication.exe</dt>
<dd>Typical (default) name for the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), whether built using monolithic build or
modular (EMODule-enabled) build.</dd>
<dt id="term-event-coordinator">event coordinator</dt>
<dd>A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign.</dd>
<dt id="term-flattened-file">flattened file</dt>
<dd>A single campaign or configuration file created by combining a default file with one or more
overlay files. Multiple files must be flattened prior to running a simulation. Configuration
files are flattened to a single-depth JSON file without nesting, the format required for
consumption by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe). Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily
used for testing and experimentation.</dd>
<dt id="term-heterogeneous-intra-node-transmission-hint">Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT)</dt>
<dd>A feature for modeling person-to-person transmission of diseases in heterogeneous population
segments within a node for generic simulations.</dd>
<dt id="term-high-performance-computing-hpc">high-performance computing (HPC)</dt>
<dd>The use of parallel processing for running advanced applications efficiently, reliably,
and quickly.</dd>
<dt id="term-input-data-files">input data files</dt>
<dd>Fixed information used as input to a simulation. Examples of such data are population,
altitude, demographics, and transportation migrations. The configurable config.json and
campaign.json files do not fall into this category of static fixed input.</dd>
<dt id="term-intervention">intervention</dt>
<dd>An object aimed at reducing the spread of a disease that is distributed either to an
individual; such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet; or to a node; such as a larvicide. Additionally,
initial disease outbreaks and intermediate interventions that schedule another intervention
are implemented as interventions in the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-campaign-file"><span class="xref std std-term">campaign file</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-javascript-object-notation-json">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</dt>
<dd>A human-readable, open standard, text-based file format for data interchange. It is
typically used to represent simple data structures and associative arrays, and is language-
independent.</dd>
<dt id="term-keyhole-markup-language-kml">Keyhole Markup Language (KML)</dt>
<dd>A file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser, for example, Google Maps.
The format uses an XML-based structure (tag-based structure with nested elements and
attributes). Tags are case-sensitive.</dd>
<dt id="term-link-time-code-generation-ltcg">Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG)</dt>
<dd>A method for the linker to optimize code (for size and/or speed) after compilation has
occurred. The compiled code is turned not into actual code, but instead into an intermediate
language form (IL, but not to be confused with .NET IL which has a different purpose). The
LTCG then, unlike the compiler, can see the whole body of code in all object files and be
able to optimize the result more effectively.</dd>
<dt id="term-message-passing-interface-mpi">Message Passing Interface (MPI)</dt>
<dd>An interface used to pass information between computing cores in parallel simulations. One
example is the migration of individuals from one geographic location to another within EMOD
simulations.</dd>
<dt id="term-microsolver">microsolver</dt>
<dd>A microsolver is a type of &#8220;miniature model&#8221; that operates within the framework of EMOD
to compute a particular set of parameters. Each microsolver, in effect, is creating a
microsimulation in order to accurately capture the dynamics of that particular aspect of the
model.</dd>
<dt id="term-monte-carlo">Monte Carlo</dt>
<dd>Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a class of computational algorithms
utilizing repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo simulations create
probability distributions for possible outcome values, which provides a more realistic way of
describing uncertainty in variables.</dd>
<dt id="term-monolithic-build">monolithic build</dt>
<dd>A single EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) with no DLLs that includes all components as part of Eradication.exe itself. You
can still use EMODules with the monolithic build; for example, a
custom reporter is a common type of EMODule. View the documentation on EMODules and
emodules_map.json for more information about creation and use of EMODules.</dd>
<dt id="term-node">node</dt>
<dd>A grid size that is used for modeling geographies. Within EMOD, a node is a geographic
region containing simulated individuals. Individuals migrate between nodes either
temporarily or permanently using mobility patterns driven by local, regional, and long-
distance transportation.</dd>
<dt id="term-node-targeted-intervention">node-targeted intervention</dt>
<dd>An intervention that is distributed to a geographical node rather than to a single
individual. One example is larvicides, which affect all mosquitoes living and feeding within
a given node.</dd>
<dt id="term-output-report">output report</dt>
<dd>A file that is the output from an EMOD simulation. Output reports are in JSON, CSV, or binary
file format. You must pass the data from an output report to graphing software if you want to
visualize the output of a simulation.</dd>
<dt id="term-overlay-file">overlay file</dt>
<dd>An additional configuration, campaign, or demographic file that overrides the default
parameter values in the primary file. Separating the parameters into multiple files is
primarily used for testing a nd experimentation. In the case of configuration and campaign
files, the files can use an arbitrary hierarchical structure to organize parameters into
logical groups. Configuration and campaign files must be flattened into a single file before
running a simulation.</dd>
<dt id="term-preview">preview</dt>
<dd>Software that undergoes a shorter testing cycle in order to make it available
more quickly. Previews may contain software defects that could result in unexpected
behavior. Use EMOD previews at your own discretion.</dd>
<dt id="term-regression-test">regression test</dt>
<dd>A test to verify that existing EMOD functionality works with new
updates, typically used to refer to one of a set of scenarios included in the EMOD
bundle  and located in the Regression subdirectory of the bundle. Directory names of each
subdirectory  in Regression describe the main regression attributes, for example,
&#8220;1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNode&#8221;. Also can refer to the process of regression testing of
software.</dd>
<dt id="term-release">release</dt>
<dd>Software that includes new functionality, scientific tutorials leveraging new or existing
functionality, and/or bug fixes that have been thoroughly tested so that any defects have
been fixed before release. EMOD releases undergo full regression testing.</dd>
<dt id="term-reporter">reporter</dt>
<dd>Functionality that extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and saves it as an
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-output-report"><span class="xref std std-term">output report</span></a>. EMOD provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from
simulations and you also have the ability to create a custom reporter.</dd>
<dt id="term-scenario">scenario</dt>
<dd>A collection of input, configuration, and campaign files that describes a real-world
example of a disease outbreak and interventions. Many scenarios are included with EMOD
source installations or are available in the Regression directory of the EMOD GitHub repository.
The tutorials describe how to run simulations using these scenarios to learn more about
epidemiology and disease modeling.</dd>
<dt id="term-schema">schema</dt>
<dd>A text or JSON file that can be generated from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) that defines all
configuration and campaign parameters.</dd>
<dt id="term-simulation">simulation</dt>
<dd>An EMOD software execution performed by the kernel. Each simulation has an associated
set of files that control the inputs, configuration, and campaign.</dd>
<dt id="term-simulation-type">simulation type</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The disease or disease class to model.</p>
<p>EMOD supports the following simulation types for modeling a variety of diseases:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Generic disease (GENERIC_SIM)</li>
<li>Vector-borne diseases (VECTOR_SIM)</li>
<li>Malaria (MALARIA_SIM)</li>
<li>Tuberculosis (TB_SIM)</li>
<li>Sexually transmitted infections (STI_SIM)</li>
<li>HIV (HIV_SIM)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt id="term-solvers">solvers</dt>
<dd>Solvers are used to find computational solutions to problems. In simulations, they can be used,
for example, to determine the time of the next simulation step, or to compute the states of
a model at particular time steps.</dd>
<dt id="term-standard-template-library-stl">Standard Template Library (STL)</dt>
<dd>A library that contains a set of common C++ classes (including generic algorithms and data
structures) that are independent of container and implemented as templates, which enables
compile-time polymorphism (often more efficient than run-time polymorphism). For more
information and discussion of STL, see <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">Wikipedia</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-state-transition-event">state transition event</dt>
<dd>A change in state (e.g. healthy to infected, undiagnosed to positive diagnosis, or birth)
that may trigger a subsequent action, often an intervention. &#8220;Campaign events&#8221; should not be
confused with state transition events.</dd>
<dt id="term-time-step">time step</dt>
<dd>A discrete number of hours or days in which the &#8220;simulation states&#8221; of all &#8220;simulation
objects&#8221; (interventions, infections, immune systems, or individuals) are updated in a
simulation. Each time step will complete processing before launching the next one. For
example, a time step would process the migration data for populations moving between nodes
via rail, airline, and road. The migration of individuals between nodes is the last step of
the time step after updating states.</dd>
<dt id="term-tutorial">tutorial</dt>
<dd>A set of instructions in the documentation to learn more about epidemiology and
disease modeling. Tutorials are based on real-world scenarios and demonstrate the mechanics
of the the model. Each tutorial consists of one or more scenarios.</dd>
<dt id="term-working-directory">working directory</dt>
<dd>The directory that contains the configuration and campaign files for a simulation. You must
be in this directory when you invoke Eradication.exe at the command line to run a simulation.</dd>

and disease modeling.</p>
<dl class="glossary docutils">
<dt id="term-antigen">antigen</dt>

production of one or more antibodies.</dd>
<dt id="term-clausius-clayperon-relation">Clausius-Clayperon relation</dt>
<dd>A way of characterizing a transition between two phases of matter; provides a method to find
a relationship between temperature and pressure along phase boundaries. Frequently used in
meteorology and climatology to describe the behavior of water vapor. See <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation">Wikipedia -
Clausius-Clayperon relation</a>
for more information.</dd>
<dt id="term-deterministic">deterministic</dt>

<dd>Used in mathematics and computational science, this method is a first-order numerical
procedure for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value.</dd>
<dt id="term-exp">exp(</dt>
<dd>The exponential function, <img class="math" src="_images/math/2ee52b30b1b74c38ee0551aa1e1c265c6239e33a.png" alt="e^x"/>, where <img class="math" src="_images/math/78a06cf7a34f39fde71fbba0d5539baae7c72d4e.png" alt="e"/> is the number (approximately 2.718281828)
such that the function <img class="math" src="_images/math/2ee52b30b1b74c38ee0551aa1e1c265c6239e33a.png" alt="e^x"/> is its own derivative. The exponential function is used to
model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same
proportional change (i.e. percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. The
function is often written as <img class="math" src="_images/math/076beb54cb2e0283d1188856ecded23cfa16b984.png" alt="exp(x)"/>. The graph of <img class="math" src="_images/math/83c91415fc0728cbbc609106cb9c2a5854602878.png" alt="y = exp(x)"/> is upward-sloping

the risk of contracting a disease.</dd>
<dt id="term-koppen-geiger-climate-classification-system">Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification System</dt>
<dd>A system based on the concept that native vegetation is a good expression of climate. Thus,
climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind. It combines
average annual and monthly temperatures and precipitation, and the seasonality of
precipitation. EMOD has several options for configuring the climate, namely air
temperature, rainfall, and humidity. One option utilizes Input Files that associate
geographic nodes with Koppen climate indices. The modified Koppen classification uses three
letters to divide the world into five major climate regions (A, B, C, D, and E) based on
average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly
temperature. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on temperature and
precipitation. While the Koppen system does not take such things as temperature extremes,
average cloud cover, number of days with sunshine, or wind into account, it is a good
representation of our earth&#8217;s climate.</dd>
<dt id="term-loss-to-follow-up-ltfu">loss to follow-up (LTFU)</dt>
<dd>Patients who at one point were actively participating in disease treatment or clinical

<dd>In contrast to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-routine-immunization-ri"><span class="xref std std-term">routine immunization (RI)</span></a>, SIAs are large-scale operations with a
goal of delivering vaccines to every household.</dd>
<dt id="term-waifw-matrix">WAIFW matrix</dt>
<dd>A matrix of values that describes the rate of transmission between different population
groups. WAIFW is an abbrevation for Who Acquires Infection From Whom.</dd>
<dt id="term-weibull-distribution">Weibull distribution</dt>
<dd>A probability distribution often used in EMOD and that requires both a shape parameter
and a scale parameter. The shape parameter governs the shape of the density function. When
the shape parameter is equal to 1, it is an exponential distribution. For shape parameters
above 1, it forms a unimodal (hump-shaped) density function. As the shape parameter becomes
large, the function forms a sharp peak. The inverse of the shape parameter is sometimes
referred to here as the “heterogeneity” of the distribution (heterogeneity = 1/shape),
because it can be helpful to think about the degree of heterogeneity of draws from the
distribution, especially for hump-shaped functions with heterogeneity values between 0 and 1
(i.e., shape parameters greater than 1). The scale parameter shifts the distribution from
left to right. When heterogeneity is small (i.e., the shape parameter is large), the scale
parameter sets the location of the sharp peak.</dd>
