HIV model overview
==================


.. Am thinking this will be the info about how the STI model works; mostly taken from the "STI Overview"
.. section in the pdf.  Right now, the sections are copied and pasted in, as-is, from the pdf; will
.. require a lot of editing!


|EMOD_s| is a modeling framework that supports multiple modes of disease transmission. One of these is
person-to-person transmission through a network of relationships. In a contact network, there is a
specific transmitter and recipient of every transmission event. To organize the network,
individuals form one or more relationships that are remembered over time.

Preference for partners is configurable through the modelâ€™s input files. Inside the model, the
"supply and demand" for types of partners is balanced by a pair formation algorithm (PFA) that, if
desired, can dynamically adjust the rates of relationship formation in each demographic category to
produce a constant mixing pattern, even with demographic changes in the population. Alternatively,
the dynamic adjustments can be turned off to allow mixing patterns to change in response to
demographic changes.


STI Overview
============
.. since HIV is built on the STI model, should give some background of STI then elaborate on how HIV differs

The STI model enables person-to-person transmission of disease, which is distinct from the vector-
borne, airborne, or waterborne transmission routes also available in EMOD.

The STI contact network enables users to configure up to three relationship types with different
durations, gender-specific levels of concurrency, age patterns of formation, and preference
functions. Partnership preference can select for partners with similar or different risk behavior,
STI infection status, and sociodemographic groupings that can be used represent geographic location,
race, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Concurrency and levels of co-infection can also be
configured independently for each risk group.

The balance of "supply and demand" of partners is handled using a feed-forward algorithm that
dynamically adjusts the rates of relationship formation as the population structure changes. Feed-
forward can be disabled during the simulation to allow future patterns of relationship formation to
change in response to demographic shifts in the population.
