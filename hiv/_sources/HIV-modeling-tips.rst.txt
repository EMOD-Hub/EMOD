HIV or STI configuration tips
=============================

.. as for malaria, this page will go with the config file pages and provide the relevant info gleaned from the tutorials


Currently, this page consists of notes of important modeling things that don't seem to quite fit into a framework yet.

To run simulations that utilize network transmission, set the parameter **Simulation_Type** to the
value "STI_SIM". To utilize the specific components for simulating HIV, set the parameter
**Simulation_Type** to the value "HIV_SIM".
.. Need to figure out what "HIV_SIM" adds in terms of options, complexity, etc.


Note that there are graphs and some equations for Weibull distributions (p. 10 in the pdf) that are not copied over.

To define the distribution of age of sexual debut, three parameters are specified: the Weibull
heterogeneity parameter, the Weibull scale parameter, and the minimum possible age of sexual debut.
The first two parameters parameters can be set to different values for males and females. The third
para-meter prevents debut ages lower than a specific value, even if the Weibull distribution has
some mass below that value. These parameters are located in the config.json input file, and are
tabulated below: [did not include the table, p. 11]
