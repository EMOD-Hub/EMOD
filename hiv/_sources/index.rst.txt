===============================
Welcome to |IDM_s| HIV modeling
===============================

The |IDM_l| develops complex software modeling. The primary software, |EMOD_l|, helps determine the
combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. We
share this modeling software with the research community to advance the understanding of disease
dynamics.

Documentation structure
=======================

|IDM_s| recently separated the documentation into a training set that walks through tutorials that
provide an introduction to disease modeling and disease-specific sets that provide guidance for
researchers modeling particular diseases. For example, this documentation set includes general
installation and usage instructions in addition to content specific to modeling HIV and other
sexually transmitted infections.

"Using the model" contains information for researchers who want to create simulations of disease
dynamics using |EMOD_s| as developed by |IDM_s|.

"Advancing the model" contains information for researchers and developers who want to modify
the |EMOD_s| source code to add more functionality to the model.
