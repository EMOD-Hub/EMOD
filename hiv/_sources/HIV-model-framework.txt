HIV model structure and framework
=================================


The HIV |EMOD_s| is complex, with numerous configurable parameters. The following network
diagram breaks down the model into various model components, and illustrates how they interact with
one another.  The components on the network diagram correspond to the structural components  listed
below. Note that there is  not perfect overlap between the labels on the network diagram and the
structural components; this is because the network is drawn with increased detail in order to
provide clarity in how the model functions and the components interact. The following pages will
describe in detail how the structural components function.

.. this is taken from the malaria page. Need to edit for HIV.

.. create and insert a network diagram for HIV.

See the :doc:`parameter-overview` for a complete description of all configurable parameters for
the HIV model.


HIV model structural components
===============================

The model's modular framework includes the following components:

.. need to figure out what the components are, and add them to the toctree!
