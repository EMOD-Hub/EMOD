<h1>Introduction to disease modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-disease-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To understand the complex dynamics underlying disease transmission, epidemiologists utilize a set of
models called compartmental models. Developed in the early 20th century, these models  stratify a
population into groups, generally based on their risk or infection status. Underlying these models
is a system of differential equations, so the model is able to track the population as a function of
time.  Further, the models track the number of people in each category, are able to predict the
various properties of pathogen spread, can estimate the duration of epidemics, and can be used to
understand how different situations or interventions can impact the outcome of pathogen spread. To
see a typical plot of a population in SIR conditions, see the plot in <a class="reference internal" href="#types-of-compartmental-models">Types of compartmental models</a>. If you would like a more in-depth introduction to epidemiology and disease modeling, you
may want to take the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics/home/welcome">Epidemics</a> course from The Pennsylvania State University through Coursera.</p>
<p>An <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-agent-based-model"><span class="xref std std-term">agent-based model</span></a> (ABM) is another powerful tool used to help understand the complexity
inherent in disease transmission systems. These models form a type of “microscale model,” where they
simulate the simultaneous interactions of agents in an effort to re-crate complex phenomena.  Each
agent (such as a human, or vector) can be assigned a variety of “properties” (for example, age, gender, etc),
and their behavior and interactions with one another are determined by using decision rules. These
models have strong predictive power, and  are able to leverage spatial and temporal dynamics.
Further, complex environments can be developed in which the agents act, and agents may “learn” from
interactions or “adapt” to their environment. As a result, ABMs are excellent for identifying
“emerging properties” of the system: patterns that are not explicitly modeled, but instead occur as
a consequence of the rules that govern the agents.</p>
<p>Agent-based models are extensively used in epidemiology due to their predictive power in modeling
the spread (or conversely, control) of epidemics.  A popular type of ABM for this is one in which
each agent’s rules follow the dynamics specified in the compartmental models, where each agent flows
through the compartments as a function of both “within-host” rules (such as duration of infection) and
interactions between agents (such as becoming infected when coming into contact with an infectious
agent). By combining the epidemiological basis of compartmental models with the flexibility of an
agent-based model, this type of ABM is quite powerful due to their ability to simultaneously address
the ecology, epidemiology, and pathology of complex systems.</p>

<h2>Why use disease modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-disease-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Disease models play an important role in understanding and managing the transmission dynamics of
various pathogens.  We can use them to describe the spatial and temporal patterns of disease
prevalence, as well as to explore or better understand the factors that influence infection
incidence. Modeling is a key step in understanding what treatments and interventions can be most
effective, how cost-effective these approaches may be, and what specific factors need to be
considered when trying to eradicate disease.</p>

<h3>SI (Susceptible - Infectious) model<a class="headerlink" href="#si-susceptible-infectious-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this situation, people never leave the infectious state and have life-long infections. For
example, herpes is a disease with life-long infectiousness. The dashed line shows how the model
becomes an SIS (Susceptible - Infectious - Susceptible) model, where infection does not confer
immunity (or there is waning immunity). Individuals have repeat or reoccurring infections, and
infected individuals return to the susceptible state. For example, sexually transmitted diseases
such as gonorrhea or chlamydia fall into this group.</p>

<p>In this category, individuals experience a long  incubation duration (the “exposed” category), such
that the individual is <em>infected</em> but not yet  <em>infectious</em>. For example chicken pox, and even
vector-borne diseases such as  Dengue Hemorrhagic fever have a long incubation duration where the
individual cannot yet transmit the pathogen to others. The dashed line shows how the model becomes
an SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered - Susceptible)   model, where recovered
people may become susceptible again (recovery does not confer life-long immunity).   For example,
rotovirus and malaria are diseases with long incubation durations, and where infection only confers
temporary immunity.</p>

disease will spread. It is essentially a measure of the expected or average outcome of transmission.
This is the threshold parameter used to determine whether or not an epidemic will occur, and determines:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>The initial rate of increase of an epidemic (the exponential growth phase).</li>
<li>The final size of an epidemic (what fraction of susceptibles will be infected).</li>
<li>The endemic equilibrium fraction of susceptibles in a population (=1/ R<sub>0</sub>).</li>
<li>The critical vaccination threshold, which is equal to 1-(1/ R<sub>0</sub>), and determines the
number of people that must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of a pathogen.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Disability-adjusted life years (DALY)</dt>
<dd>The number of years of life lost due to premature mortality
plus the  years lost due to disability while infected. Used to quantify the burden of disease.</dd>
<dt>Epidemic</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An outbreak of an infectious disease, such that a greater number of individuals than normal
has the disease. Epidemics have very high R<sub>0</sub> (Recall R<sub>0</sub>&gt;1 for a disease to spread)
and are often associated with acute, highly transmissible pathogens that can be directly transmitted.
Further, pathogens with lower infectious periods create more explosive epidemics.</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>To control epidemics, it is necessary to reduce R<sub>0</sub>. This can be done by:<ul>
<li>Reducing transmissibility.</li>
<li>Decreasing the number of susceptibles (by vaccination, for example).</li>
<li>Decreasing the mean number of contacts or the transmissibility, such as by improving sanitation,
or limiting the number of interactions sick people have with healthy people.</li>
<li>Reducing length of infectious period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Force of infection (FoI)</dt>
<dd>A measure of the degree to which an infected individual can spread infection;
the per-capita rate at which susceptibles contract infection. Typically increases with
transmissibility and prevalence of infection.</dd>
<dt>Herd immunity</dt>
<dd>Vaccines protect individuals, but also provide indirect protection to anyone those
vaccinated people may have infected. The portion of the population that needs to be immunized in
order to achieve herd immunity is  P &gt; 1 – (1/ R<sub>0</sub>), where P = proportion vaccinated * vaccine

<dd>Also known as the effective contact rate, is the product of the
contact rate and the probability of transmission per contact.</dd>
<dt>Virulence</dt>
<dd>The capacity of a pathogen to produce disease. It is proportional to parasitemia,
or the number of circulating copies of the pathogen in the host. The higher the virulence (given
contact between S and I individuals), the more likely transmission is to occur. However, higher
virulence means contact may be less likely as infected hosts show more symptoms of  the disease.
There is a trade-off that occurs between high transmissibility and disease-induced mortality.</dd>
