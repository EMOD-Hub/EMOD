MDRDiagnostic
=============

The **MDRDiagnostic** intervention class is similar to :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-simplediagnostic`
and uses the same parameters as :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-diagnostictreatneg`. However,
**MDRDiagnostic** is used specifically for identifying individuals with multidrug-resistant TB
(MDR-TB). Individuals who are not infected with MDR-TB receive a negative result.
