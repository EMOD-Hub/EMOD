SmearDiagnostic
===============

The **SmearDiagnostic** intervention class identifies individuals who have active, smear-positive
TB. This intervention is similar to :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-simplediagnostic`, which
identifies infected individuals (regardless of disease state) and :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-activediagnostic`,
which identifies individuals who have active TB (regardless of disease
presentation). If a smear-positive diagnosis is returned, an actual intervention is distributed, or
an event is specified that may trigger another intervention when the event occurs.
