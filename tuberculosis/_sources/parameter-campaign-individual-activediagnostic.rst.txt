ActiveDiagnostic
================

The **ActiveDiagnostic** intervention class uses the same parameters as :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-simplediagnostic`,
but it is used specifically to identify individuals with active TB. As with **SimpleDiagnostic**,
**Base_Sensitivity** and **Base_Specificity** are used to determine the individualâ€™s test result.
Typical usage includes one-time or repeated checks for active TB in the general population.
