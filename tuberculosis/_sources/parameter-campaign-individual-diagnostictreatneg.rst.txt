==================
DiagnosticTreatNeg
==================

The **DiagnosticTreatNeg** intervention class is similar to :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-simplediagnostic`,
but enables greater specification of what occurs if an individual receives a test (particularly a
negative test, which cannot be specified using **SimpleDiagnostic** or
:doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-activediagnostic`) or defaults (such as getting tested but not
receiving test results).
