AntiTBPropDepDrug
=================

The **AntiTBPropDepDrug** intervention class is similar to :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-antitbdrug`,
as it specifies how TB drugs affect individuals in the model. This intervention enables
the simultaneous distribution of different drug treatments to specific individuals within the
population based on those individuals' **IndividualProperties** (see :ref:`demo-properties`
parameters for more information). Further, drugs can have different efficacies based on whether the
individual is drug-resistant or whether the individual is treatment-experienced. All drugs must be
configured in the configuration file under **TB_Drug_Types_For_This_Sim** and **TB_Drug_Params**
(see :ref:`config-drugs` parameters for more information).
