HealthSeekingBehaviorUpdateable
===============================

The **HealthSeekingBehaviorUpdateable** intervention class is similar to
:doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-simplehealthseekingbehavior`, but is specific to the TB model.
This intervention is used to set an initial rate of seeking care, which can be modified dynamically
by :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-healthseekingbehaviorupdate`. As an example, this intervention
can be used to model the effects of disease awareness campaigns or other interventions that help
shorten the time delay between when individuals start experiencing symptoms and when they receive care.
