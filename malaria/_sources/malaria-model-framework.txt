Malaria model structure and framework
======================================
.. this is where it would be nice to link to the model visualizations (the interactive stuff).
.. Although, they might instead be embedded on the page with the corresponding schematic. Not sure.

The malaria |EMOD_s| is complex, with numerous configurable parameters. The following network
diagram breaks down the model into various model components, and illustrates how they interact with
one another.  The components on the network diagram correspond to the structural components  listed
below. Note that there is  not perfect overlap between the labels on the network diagram and the
structural components; this is because the network is drawn with increased detail in order to
provide clarity in how the model functions and the components interact. The following pages will
describe in detail how the structural components function.

.. Do we have a way to embed links into the figure? It would be cool if it was possible to click
.. on a box on the figure, and go to that component section...

.. TBD: may be getting a new version of the picture, where the vector/human transmission bit is a different color
.. will need to update the file.


 As new technology arises and novel types of interventions become available, it will be
 relatively seamless to integrate them into the current model structure. For example, as genetic
 technology improves and testing the utility of utilizing GM mosquitoes (such as a :term:`gene
 drive mosquito`) in control efforts becomes important, |EMOD_s| will have no difficulty
 integrating this novel intervention into simulations.


See the :doc:`parameter-overview` for a complete description of all configurable parameters for
the malaria model.


Malaria model structural components
===================================

The model's modular framework includes the following components:

.. any other components? Rephrase this so that it is clear it refers to the above schematic.
