SugarTrap
=========

The **SugarTrap** intervention class implements a vector sugar-baited trap to collect host-seeking mosquitoes.
This intervention affects all mosquitoes living and feeding at a given node, and requires the use of
individual mosquitoes in the simulation configuration file (**Vector_Sampling_Type** must be set to
TRACK_ALL_VECTORS or SAMPLE_IND-VECTORS), rather than using the cohort model. See :ref:`config-sampling`
configuration parameters for more information.

The impact of sugar-baited traps will depend on the sugar-feeding behavior specified in the
configuration file, whether there is no sugar feeding, sugar feeding occurs once at emergence, sugar
feeding occurs once per blood meal, or sugar feeding occurs every day. See
:ref:`config-vector-control` configuration parameters for more information.
