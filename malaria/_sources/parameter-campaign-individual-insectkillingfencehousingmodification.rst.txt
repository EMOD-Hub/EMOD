=====================================

The **InsectKillingFenceHousingModification** intervention class is similar to
:doc:`parameter-campaign-node-insectkillingfence`, but is individual-based instead of node-based. Vector control
surrounds a designated house with a fence that kills mosquitoes that fly across the path
of the fence.
