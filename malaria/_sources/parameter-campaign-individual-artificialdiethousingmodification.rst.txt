ArtificialDietHousingModification
=================================

The **ArtificialDietHousingModification** intervention class is used to include feeding stations for
vectors at an individual level in a simulation. For a node-level effect that takes place at the
village level, use :doc:`parameter-campaign-node-artificialdiet` instead. An artificial diet
diverts the vector from feeding on the human population, resulting in a two-fold benefit:

#. The uninfected mosquitoes avoid biting infected humans some of the time, therefore
   decreasing the amount of human-to-vector transmission.

#. Infectious vectors are diverted to feed on the artificial diet instead of the humans, therefore
   decreasing the amount of vector-to-human transmission.
