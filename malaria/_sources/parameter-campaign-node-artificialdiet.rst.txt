ArtificialDiet
==============

The **ArtificialDiet** intervention class is used to include feeding stations for vectors within a
node in a simulation. This is a node-targeted intervention and takes effect at the broad village
level rather than at the individual level. For individual-level effect, use
:doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-artificialdiethousingmodification` instead. An artificial diet
diverts the vector from feeding on the human population, resulting in a two-fold benefit:

#. The uninfected mosquitoes avoid biting infected humans some of the time, therefore
   decreasing the amount of human-to-vector transmission.

#. Infectious vectors are diverted to feed on the artificial diet instead of the humans, therefore
   decreasing the amount of vector-to-human transmission.
