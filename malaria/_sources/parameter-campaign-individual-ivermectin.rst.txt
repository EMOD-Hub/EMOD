Ivermectin
==========

The **Ivermectin** intervention class modifies the feeding outcome probabilities for both indoor-
feeding and outdoor-feeding mosquitoes. It is an individually-distributed intervention that
configures the waning of the drug's killing effect on the adult mosquito population. This
intervention enables exploration of the impact of giving humans an insecticidal drug, and how the
effectiveness and duration of the drug's killing-effect interacts with other interventions. For
example, you can look at the impact of controlling and eliminating malaria transmission using both
anti-parasite drugs that clear existing infections and insecticidal drugs.
