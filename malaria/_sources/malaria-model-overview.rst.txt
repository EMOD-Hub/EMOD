Malaria model overview
=======================

The |EMOD_l|, malaria model, is an agent-based, discrete time, :term:`Monte Carlo` simulator used to
simulate malaria conditions in order to evaluate the effectiveness of eradication or mitigation
approaches. The model utilizes microsolvers to combine detailed vector population dynamics, human
population dynamics, human immunity, within-host parasite dynamics, effects of antimalarial drugs,
and other aspects of malaria biology to simulate malaria transmission. |EMOD_s| can be calibrated to
particular geographic locations, and the :term:`microsolver` framework enables the model's
functionality to be highly modifiable. Further, the framework includes the ability to add
intervention campaigns, and those interventions can be specified to target particular populations or
sub-populations of human or vector groups. Interventions can be deployed within simulations for a
variety of transmission settings with different transmission intensities, vector behaviors, and
seasonally-driven ecologies.



The following pages describe the structure of the model, and then explore each of the model components.
Additionally, the specifics of the model are discussed in detail in the articles

The generic software architecture of |EMOD_s| can be found on :doc:`intro-overview`.  The malaria
|EMOD_s| is based on the same architecture, with modifications that transform the generic model into
a vector-based model. For example, transmission occurs via vectors (and the associated climatalogical
impacts on vector biology), individuals can have multiple infections, and campaign interventions can
act at the individual level or at the :term:`node` level.

Typical SEIR models are described in :doc:`intro-modeling`. Vectors add a level of
complexity to the interactions, as pathogens are transmitted via vector - human - vector. For
malaria, the SEIR model would appear as follows:

While |EMOD_s| is an agent-based model, both the simulated humans and vectors move through the
various infection states analogously to the compartmental model illustrated above.  To account for
the real-world complexity of malaria transmission, numerous parameters have been added to |EMOD_s|
to increase its predictive power. Further, these parameters and their associated microsolvers allow
|EMOD_s| to model aspects of malaria infections and population dynamics that do not readily fit into
the SEIRS framework (for example, within-host parasite dynamics, parasitalogical immunity, and
innate and adaptive responses to antigens). Finally, as an agent- based model, |EMOD_s| enables the
addition of spatial and temporal properties to the simulation. The following pages describe this
complexity in detail.
