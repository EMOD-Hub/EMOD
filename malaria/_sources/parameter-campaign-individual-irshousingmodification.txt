IRSHousingModification
======================

The **IRSHousingModification** intervention class includes Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in the
simulation. IRS is another key vector control tool in which insecticide is sprayed on the interior
walls of a house so that mosquitoes resting on the walls after consuming a blood meal will die. IRS
can also have a repellency effect.
