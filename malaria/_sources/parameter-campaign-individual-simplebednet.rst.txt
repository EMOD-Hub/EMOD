The **SimpleBednet** intervention class implements Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs) in the
simulation. ITNs are a key component of modern malaria control efforts, and have recently been
scaled up towards universal coverage in sub-Saharan Africa. Modern bednets are made of a
polyethylene or polyester mesh, which is impregnated with a slowly releasing pyrethroid insecticide.
Mosquitoes that are seeking a blood meal will encounter a net and, if the net retains its physical
integrity and has been correctly installed, the feeding attempt is blocked. Blocked feeding attempts
also carry the possibility of killing the mosquito. Net ownership is configured through the
demographic coverage, and the blocking and killing rates of mosquitoes are time- dependent.
