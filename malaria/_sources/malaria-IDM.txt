Malaria research at |IDM_s|
===========================


Malaria research at |IDM_s| is progressive and dynamic. For the current research, research team
profiles, and a full list of published papers from IDM's malaria group,  see the
`IDM Malaria Research Website <http://idmod.org/research/malaria>`_.


.. also want to link to the IDM Google Scholar page once that gets set up.

.. per Jaline's suggestion, will list/link papers specific to the topics provided under each heading.

.. question for this: do we want ALL papers on here, or just the first couple or so that created that topic?
.. currently am going with "all"

.. follow up question: for papers that fit multiple categories, put them down twice? Or pick the best one?
.. Or pick the best one and also ref the other category? (Currently put them in "best fit" spot only)

.. will have to make a decision about updating this. Options: 1. Let the malaria team do it. 2. Only include
.. the "most relevant" papers, so that it doesn't need to get updated. 3. Try to remember to add papers on to it...

.. don't have the "fun with maths" paper on here; it didn't seem to fit in the topics, since it's about modeling in general
.. also don't have the "separatrix algorithm" paper on here (not really about malaria!)
.. don't have "enviro data set" paper, as it's about creating data and not the malaria emod
.. don't mention the malERA paper or the group...can if it's desired!

.. NOTE: SOME TITLES ARE IN TITLE CASE, SOME IN SENTENCE CASE ON PURPOSE. THEY MIRROR WHAT CASE THE JOURNAL USES.
.. Figured it made sense to make it match how it's published, but we can make them all sentence case...

.. Eckhoff 2013  Am J Trop Med Hyg could fit with infection/immunity w/in host dynamics...
.. Eckhoff 2012 (malaria journal) could fit with infection/immunity w/in host dynamics...
.. McCarthy et al could also go in the infection/immunity section
.. Nikolov et al could also fit with "interventions"
.. Gerardin et al  2016 PLOS comp bio could also fit with "interventions"
