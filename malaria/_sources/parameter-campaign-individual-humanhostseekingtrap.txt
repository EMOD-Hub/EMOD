HumanHostSeekingTrap
====================

The **HumanHostSeekingTrap** intervention class applies a trap that attracts and kills host-seeking
mosquitoes in the simulation. Human-host-seeking traps are individually-distributed interventions
that have attraction and killing rates that decay in an analogous fashion to the blocking and
killing rates of bednets.
