Larvicides
==========

The **Larvicides** intervention class configures habitat reduction for mosquito breeding sites that are poisoned
by vector-transported larvicides. This intervention accommodates vector-transported larvicides where
resting surfaces may be treated not just with **IRSHousingModification** to kill mosquitoes, but
also with particles that can be dispersed by mosquitoes to poison larval development sites. In
particular, a relatively small fraction of resting events may result in a relatively large fraction
of larval habitat.
