Malaria model
-------------

Several habitat parameters in the malaria model have been upgraded, creating more flexibility in
the model and enabling the user to have more control over habitat customization. These changes
allow the model to more accurately capture real-world habitat availability and how it affects
different mosquito species.

**LINEAR_SPLINE** habitat type
    This new option under **Larval_Habitat_Types** increases model customization by allowing the
    user to specify an arbitrary functional form (derived from data) for larval habitat
    availability throughout the year, instead of relying on climatological parameters such as
    rainfall or temperature. For more information, see :ref:`config-larval` parameters.

**LarvalHabitatMultiplier** by species
    This new feature in demographics allows larval habitat availability to be modified
    independently for each species sharing a particular habitat type. Prior versions of |EMOD_s|
    applied the same modifier to all species within a shared habitat; this upgrade enables you
    to apply modifiers to individual species within a habitat. For more information, see
    :ref:`demo-nodeattributes` parameters.

**ScaleLarvalHabitat** by species
    This new intervention enables species-specific effects of habitat interventions within
    shared habitat types, such that habitat availability is modified on a per-species level.
    For more information, see :ref:`iv-scalelarvalhabitat` parameters.

Breaking changes
    PIECEWISE_MONTHLY has been changed to LINEAR_SPLINE.
