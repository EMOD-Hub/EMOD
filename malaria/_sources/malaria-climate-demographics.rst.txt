Climate and demographics spatial data
=====================================

Climate is especially important in vector models, as it is a key determinant of the geographic
distribution and seasonality of malaria. Climate, which includes rainfall, temperature, and
humidity, directly influences availability of larval habitat,  determines mosquito developmental and
survival rates, and impacts human behavior that leads to contact with infectious mosquitoes.

This framework explores the impact of different locations and weather patterns in single
:term:`node` and multi-node geographies. It explores demographics data for births, deaths, age
initialization and immunity. Climate and demographics spatial data is configured for a geographic
location, such as a rainfall-driven larval habitat, to create a climate-based distribution model of
malaria transmission. The seasonality of species abundances are considered, as are rainfall,
temperature, humidity and larval dynamics. Mosquito species and seasonality are depicted
by habitat preferences that are, for example, temporary, semi-permanent or permanent.

Clearly, climate and habitat type are inextricably linked. However, it is possible to have several
types of habitat within a given climate region; for this reason, climate is configured separately
from  habitat type.  You may choose from a variety of options to configure climate, ranging from
pre-set classification systems to uploaded user data. Further,  it is possible to enable
stochasticity in climate as well as in rainfall patterns. For example,  rainfall data may be based
off of monthly totals averaged per day. In the simulation configuration file, the parameter
**Enable_Rainfall_Stochasticity** will set up daily rainfalls drawn from an exponential distribution
with the same daily mean. This preserves approximate monthly totals, but produces a more realistic
rainfall pattern for the simulation. For more information on how to configure climate, see
:doc:`file-climate`. And for more information on the particular habitat types that are configurable
in |EMOD_s| see :doc:`malaria-larval-habitat`.

  The |EMOD_s| vector model utilizes site-specific climate and demographics data to accurately simulate
  vector transmission in a given geographic location.

.. make sure this picture is ok; it's from comps, so not sure we want to show the input file creator??
.. basically wanted to add a picture, and this was the first thing that came to mind.

See :doc:`intro-inputs` for more information on configuring demographics. For a complete list
