====================================
Welcome to |IDM_s| malaria modeling
====================================

The |IDM_l| develops complex software for disease modeling. The primary software, |EMOD_l|, helps determine the
combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. We
share this modeling software with the research community to advance the understanding of disease
dynamics.

Documentation structure
=======================

We recently separated the documentation into disease-specific documentation. For example, this
documentation set includes general installation and usage instructions in addition to content
specific to modeling malaria and other vector-borne diseases.

"Using the model" contains information for researchers who want to create simulations of disease
dynamics using |EMOD_s| as developed by |IDM_s|.

"Advancing the model" contains information for researchers and developers who want to modify
the |EMOD_s| source code to add more functionality to the model.

.. Link to the malaria tutorials??? have a page called malaria-training-tutorials that we can use to link to the scenarios
.. Milen: vector-genetic-modifications info?? (is it different than the parasite genetics page?)
