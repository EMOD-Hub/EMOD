============================
Vector species output report
============================

The vector species output report is a JSON-formatted file where the channel data has been sorted
into bins. It is identical to the :doc:`file-binned`, with the exception that the bins are based
on vector species. The vector species report is generated for all malaria or vector simulations that
contain values in the **Vector_Species_Names** configuration parameter. For example, if
**Vector_Species_Names** was set to ["funestus", "gambiae"], you would be able to see how many
infectious vectors there were for *A. funestus* and *A. gambiae*. The file name is
VectorSpeciesReport.json.

The following is a sample of an VectorSpeciesReport.json file.
