<h1>Malaria disease overview<a class="headerlink" href="#malaria-disease-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to malaria modeling at the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM)! We are committed to supporting data-driven malaria
control and elimination efforts. This page will provide information about the disease itself. The
following pages will provide information about the the vector class of Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD), the software

<div class="section" id="malaria-biology">
<h2>Malaria biology<a class="headerlink" href="#malaria-biology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by <em>plasmodium</em> parasites  transmitted through the bite of
blood-feeding <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitos. There are roughly 30 species of Anophelenes capable of serving
as malaria vectors, and only females bite (i.e. seek blood meals) to gain nutrients necessary for
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-oviposition"><span class="xref std std-term">oviposition</span></a>.  After taking blood meals, females lay eggs in water sources, where the emerging larvae
hatch and mature. Each species of <em>Anopheles</em> has different aquatic habitat preferences, ranging from
small, ephemeral pools to large swampy areas, and in some cases, brackish water.</p>
<p>Transmission of malaria depends on both biotic and abiotic factors. Mosquito lifespan is positively
correlated to transmission intensity. Mosquito populations, and therefore transmission, tend to be
seasonal with dependence on climatic conditions such as rainfall patterns, humidity, and
temperature. Typically, malaria transmission peaks during and after the rainy season, when
conditions are prime for mosquito reproduction. Additionally, transmission is dependent on human
immunity: people living in areas of high exposure to malaria can develop partial immunity, which
reduces the risk of developing severe disease. Unfortunately, such partial immunity may mask
symptoms of disease (and obscure infection), which may hinder control or elimination efforts.</p>
<p>Once an infected mosquito bites a human and transmits parasites, the parasites multiply in the
host’s liver, then infect and destroy red blood cells (erythrocytes). During the blood stage, the
parasites that infect and destroy erythrocytes release <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-merozoites"><span class="xref std std-term">merozoites</span></a> which then infect other
erythrocytes.  The <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-gametocyte"><span class="xref std std-term">gametocyte</span></a> form of the blood-stage parasite are ingested
by female Anophelenes during future blood meals, where the mosquito-based life cycle continues.</p>
<p>In the mosquito, the ingested gametocytes generate zygotes in the mosquito’s gut. Those zygotes
undergo development, embed into the mosquito’s midgut wall, and mature into oocytes. Oocytes develop
and in turn rupture, releasing the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-sporozoite"><span class="xref std std-term">sporozoite</span></a> form of the parasite. The sporozoites travel
to and reside in the mosquito’s salivary glands. Then, when the female takes a blood meal, the
sporozoites are  injected into the host, starting another infection cycle. The mosquito is the
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-vector"><span class="xref std std-term">vector</span></a> that transmits pathogens between human hosts.  See the below figure and figure
caption for an illustrated description of this process.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id3">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><em>Plasmodium</em> life cycle, adapted from the CDC, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/index.html">Malaria Biology</a>.
During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito inoculates sporozoites into
the human host (1) . Sporozoites infect liver cells (2) and mature into schizonts (3), which
rupture and release merozoites (4). After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic
schizogony, “A”), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic
schizogony, “B”). Merozoites infect red blood cells (5). Some parasites differentiate into sexual
erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) (7). The gametocytes are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito
during a blood meal (8). The parasites’ multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic
cycle, “C”. While in the mosquito’s stomach, the gametocytes generate zygotes (9). The zygotes in
turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) (10) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where
they develop into oocysts (11). The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites (12), which make
their way to the mosquito’s salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host (1)
perpetuates the malaria life cycle.</span></p>

<div class="section" id="symptoms">
<h2>Symptoms<a class="headerlink" href="#symptoms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All the clinical symptoms associated with malaria are caused by the asexual erythrocytic (or blood
stage) parasites. Malaria has a long incubation period, so symptoms do not develop immediately after
a person has been bitten by an infectious mosquito; they can occur  7 days after
infection, but this may vary up to 30 days.</p>
<p>Symptoms of malaria range in severity, but include fever, headache, body-ache, chills, and vomiting.
Severe malaria can develop when the infection is not treated, and may result in organ failure or even
death. Examples of severe malaria include cerebral malaria, severe anemia, respiratory distress (due
to accumulated fluid in the lungs), kidney failure, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and other
maladies. Death can occur from anemia, hypoglycemia, or cerebral malaria (where capillaries leading
to the brain are blocked; typically resulting in coma, brain damage or learning disabilities).</p>
<p>Confirmed diagnosis of malaria is done through observation of parasites in the blood, as seen on the
below microscopic image.  In highly endemic areas, treatment typically occurs prior to diagnostic
confirmation, as malaria is more easily cured with prompt treatment.</p>

<h2>Prevention &amp; control efforts<a class="headerlink" href="#prevention-control-efforts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are numerous types of strategies used to control malaria.  As a vector-borne disease, there are
multiple stages at which the transmission cycle can be broken.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Vector control: strategies that take into account vector ecology. These include:<ul>
<li>Chemical control, such as insecticide spraying or use of larvicides.</li>
<li>Reduction of or elimination of mosquito larval habitat, through drainage or use of biological controls.</li>
<li>Potential use of genetic modification (with tools such as <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-crispr"><span class="xref std std-term">CRISPR</span></a>) to create mosquitoes
that are resistant to infection from <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites.</li>
<li>Potential use of the bacterium <em>Wolbachia</em> to prevent mosquitoes from becoming infectious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal protection: strategies that avoid infection (by avoiding bites by infectious

<div class="section" id="global-malaria-burden">
<h2>Global malaria burden<a class="headerlink" href="#global-malaria-burden" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While progress towards reducing the malaria burden has been largely successful, malaria nevertheless
remains a major health problem and target of focused, global efforts for elimination and eradication.
According to the CDC, 3.2 billion people worldwide are at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were 214 million
cases with 483,000 deaths. Malaria is especially harmful to children: more than 70% of all malaria deaths
occur in children under the age of 5.  To put that in perspective, a child dies from malaria roughly
every 2 minutes.</p>
<p>While malaria is a global problem, the burden is not distributed equally across the globe. Sub-Saharan
Africa experiences a disproportionately high burden, with about 76% of all cases and 75% of all deaths.
South East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are also at high risk for malaria.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benefits-of-mathematical-models-in-malaria-control-and-eradication">
<h2>Benefits of mathematical models in malaria control and eradication<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-mathematical-models-in-malaria-control-and-eradication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Controlling and eventual eradication of malaria will require multifaceted and geographically-specific
intervention efforts. Heterogeneity in transmission, and transmission potential, creates a need for
combinations of interventions that can adapt to the particular malaria epidemiology of the target area.</p>
<p>For malaria, mathematical modeling and simulations are key to achieving eradication. Species-
specific vector ecology is a fundamental driver of transmission, and transmission also impacted by
the interactions of climate, human behavior, and land usage, across varying spatial scales. Modeling
these factors enables accurate representations of baseline transmission, which in turn provides a
platform to test various interventions (such as <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-insecticide-treated-nets-itn"><span class="xref std std-term">insecticide-treated nets (ITN)</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-indoor-residual-spraying-irs"><span class="xref std std-term">indoor
residual spraying (IRS)</span></a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-mass-drug-administration-mda"><span class="xref std std-term">mass drug administration (MDA)</span></a>) and combinations of interventions.
These simulation results can inform policy to develop effective–and cost effective–strategies by
exploring the many possible dimensions of coverage, frequency of distribution, and combinations of
interventions targeted to particular locations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that such a multifaceted and integrated approach to vector control and health
management is the most likely path towards elimination, as heavy reliance on singular approaches can
be problematic. For example, vector control has been widely implemented and quite successful;
however, mosquitoes are developing resistance to pyrethroids, one of the most common classes of
insecticides currently recommended for ITN or IRS to control mosquito populations.  Through modeling
approaches, researchers will be able to develop strategies that lessen dependence on particular
insecticides while maintaining successful control efforts.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-brief-history-of-malaria-modeling">
<h2>A brief history of malaria modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history-of-malaria-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Malaria has a long history of posing risks to public health, and as such, also has long been the
target of mathematical models tasked with providing solutions to ease the burden. For a more detailed
history of malaria models, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002588">Smith et al. PLOS Pathogens 2012 8(4)</a>,
and  <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/tru026">Smith et al. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 2014 108(4)</a>.
The EMOD malaria model builds upon this rich history of disease modeling to provide a novel and
rigorous approach to help guide efforts towards malaria elimination and eradication.  To fully
understand the strengths of EMOD, it is helpful to understand the modeling background from which
EMOD developed.</p>
<p>Arguably, the quantitative analysis of mosquito-borne diseases, specifically malaria,
began with Ronald Ross. In 1897 Ross confirmed that mosquitoes serve as the vector for malaria
parasites, and embarked on a career focused on disease prevention through vector control. Further,
Ross developed the modeling framework that serves as the basis for studying malaria transmission
dynamics.</p>
<p>Ross’s work inspired researchers focused on controlling mosquito-borne
diseases. His emphasis on the development of metrics useful for measuring the intensity of
transmission led to the development of :term:` entomological inoculation rate (EIR)` and motivated
research aimed at understanding mosquito movement and the relevant spatial scales for mosquito
ecology. Later, in the 1950s, George MacDonald formalized Ross’s models, and introduced the
concepts of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-vectorial-capacity"><span class="xref std std-term">vectorial capacity</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-reproductive-number"><span class="xref std std-term">reproductive number</span></a>.  This framework is now known as
the Ross-Macdonald model, and is still widely implemented in current modeling work. In fact, the
vast majority of models created in the last 40 years share most of their assumptions with the Ross-Macdonald
model (see <a class="reference external" href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/81/20120921.short">Reiner et al. 2013, Journal of the Royal Society Interface</a>.)</p>
<div class="section" id="the-garki-project">
<h3>The Garki project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-garki-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Garki project was a major milestone in malaria research.  From 1969 to 1976 this study was
conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the local government of the Jigawa State,
Nigeria, to understand the impacts of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-indoor-residual-spraying-irs"><span class="xref std std-term">indoor residual spraying (IRS)</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-mass-drug-administration-mda"><span class="xref std std-term">mass drug
administration (MDA)</span></a> on malaria transmission, as well as to evaluate the utility of mathematical
modeling. While the interventions used did not interrupt transmission at the desired level, the
model proved to be a success. The epidemiology of the <em>Plasmodium</em> parasite was realistically
replicated, even with a simplistic model, and as a result understanding of the parasite’s
epidemiology was greatly increased.</p>
<p>While the project was largely considered a failure in terms of malaria control, much was gained from
the project. Basic tenets of malaria control were learned– namely, that malaria ecology needs to be
fundamentally altered: either by modification of mosquito ecology, or by changing human ecology such
as by improving housing conditions. <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-superinfection"><span class="xref std std-term">Superinfection</span></a>,  a fundamental malaria concept modeled by
Macdonald in his first malaria model publication <a class="reference internal" href="#macdonald-1950" id="id1">[Macdonald-1950]</a>, was more correctly described by
Dietz <a class="reference internal" href="#dietz-1974" id="id2">[Dietz-1974]</a>. Further, the data set from the project is publicly available, and has become a
fundamental tool for use in malaria modeling.  For more information on this project, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://garkiproject.nd.edu/">The Garki Project</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-forward">
<h3>Moving forward<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-forward" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Ross-Macdonald model, while extremely useful and influential, has some shortcomings. The model
assumes homogeneous transmission within a well-mixed population. Host-vector ratios and numerous
aspects of mosquito feeding and development biology is assumed to remain constant. Further, all
hosts are assumed to be identical, with equal exposure to pathogens, and the probability of
transmission is proportional to host and vector densities. Interestingly, despite work demonstrating
that these assumptions are not realistic, many models still utilize them.</p>
<p>To improve on the Ross- Macdonald model, it is necessary to understand and implement increased
complexity into the transmission dynamics of the model. Transmission dynamics are not linear, and
instead depend on fine-scale heterogeneities; ecological as well as social contexts are extremely
relevant for potential host-vector interactions, and both human and mosquito movement across
relevant spatial scales also impact malaria transmission.</p>
<p>Modern research has continued to improve our understanding of both parasite biology (and genetics)
as well as within-host immune system interactions.  To fully understand the complex nature of
malaria epidemiology and how to control it, it is important to include these aspects into models.</p>
<p>The malaria EMOD leverages the history of malaria modeling by staring with these important
fundamentals and building upon them. EMOD combines detailed vector population dynamics and
interactions with human populations, and includes microsimulations for human immunity and within-
host parasite dynamics. The model builds on the work of Ross and MacDonald, leverages the Garki
model, and incorporates current modeling efforts to model multiple vector species simultaneously
interacting with a human population.</p>
